# Single Sign-on: Microsoft Azure AD

The Microsoft Azure AD SSO integration currently supports the following SAML features:

- Service Provider (SP) initiated SSO
- Identity Provider (IdP) initiated SSO
- Just-in-Time Provisioning

For more information on the listed features, visit the [Microsoft Azure AD SAML Protocol Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol).

## Team and Username Attributes

To configure team management in your Microsoft Azure AD application:

1. Navigate to the single sign-on page.
1. Edit step 2, "User Attributes & Claims."
   We recommend naming it "MemberOf", leaving the namespace blank, and potentially sourcing `user.assignedroles` as an easy starting point.

-> **Note:** When Azure AD is configured to use Group Claims, it provides Group UUIDs instead of human readable names in its SAML assertions. We recommend [configuring SSO Team IDs](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/single-sign-on#team-names-and-sso-team-ids) for your Terraform Cloud teams to match these Azure Group UUIDs.

If you plan to make use of SAML to set usernames in your Microsoft Azure AD application:

1. Navigate to the single sign-on page.
1. Edit step 2, "User Attributes & Claims."
   We recommend naming the claim "Username", leaving the namespace blank, and sourcing something like `user.displayname` or `user.mailnickname`.

If you namespaced any of your claims, note that the attribute name passed by Microsoft Azure AD will follow the form `<claim_namespace/claim_name>`. Consider this when setting Team and Username attribute names.
