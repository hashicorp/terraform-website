## Team Mapping Configuration (Okta)

Terraform Cloud can automatically add users to teams based on their SAML assertion, so you can manage team membership in your directory service. To do this, you must specify the `MemberOf` SAML attribute, and make sure the AttributeStatement in the SAML Response contains a list of AttributeValue items in the correct format (i.e., comma-separated list of team names). For additional details on this and other SSO concepts within the context of Terraform Cloud, please refer to [this](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/single-sign-on) overview page.

If you haven't yet completed all steps outlined in the [Configuration (Okta)](#configuration-okta-) section above, please do so before proceeding.

To enable this automated team mapping functionality, edit your Terraform Cloud Okta Application and complete the following steps:

1. Expand the "Attributes" section of the Application configuration (under the "Sign On" tab):

   ![The button for expanding the customizable Attributes section in the Okta portal appears to the left of the text "Attributes (optional)"](/img/docs/okta-attribute-settings.png)

1. Set the "Group Attribute Statements" to the following:

   - Name: `MemberOf`
   - Name format: `Basic`
   - Filter: `Matches regex`
   - Filter value: `.*`

   ![The customizable Group Attribute fields appear beneath the text "Group Attribute Statements (optional)"](/img/docs/okta-team-mapping.png)

Once these configuration steps have been completed, **all** Okta groups to which a given user belongs will be passed in the SAML assertion upon login to Terraform Cloud, which means that user will get added automatically to any teams within Terraform Cloud for which thereâ€™s an **exact** name match.  Importantly, please note that those users will also be removed from any teams that _aren't_ included in their assertion. This overrides any manually set team memberships, so whenever a user logs in via SSO, their team membership is adjusted to match their SAML assertion.

![The groups to which a user belongs are passed as values in the SAML assertion.  These values appear under the "AttributeStatement" block, with each unique name housed within its own individual "AttributeValue" block](/img/docs/okta-saml-assertion.png)

Using the above SAML assertion as an example, the user in question would get added to the `Everyone`, `ops`, and `test` teams in Terraform Cloud if those teams exist in the target Organization, but those values will simply be ignored if no matching team name is found.
