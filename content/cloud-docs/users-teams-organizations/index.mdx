# Users, Teams, and Organizations

Terraform Cloud's organizational and access control model is based on three units: users, teams, and organizations.

- [Users](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users) are individual members of an organization. They belong to teams, which
  are granted permissions on an organization’s workspaces.
- [Teams](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams) are groups of users that reflect your company's organizational
  structure. Organization owners can create teams and manage their membership.
- [Organizations](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations) are shared spaces for teams to collaborate on workspaces.
  An organization can have many teams, and the owners of the organization set
  which teams have which permissions on which workspaces.
