# Organizations

Organizations are a shared space for one or more [teams][] to collaborate on workspaces.

## API and Terraform Enterprise Provider

In addition to the Terraform Cloud UI, you can use the following methods to manage organizations:
- [Organizations API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/organizations)
- The `tfe` provider [`tfe_organization`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/organization) resource

## Selecting Organizations

Terraform Cloud displays your current organization in the left of the top navigation bar. To select an organization:

- Click the current organization name to view a list of all the organizations where you are a member.
- Click an organization to select it.

## Joining and Leaving Organizations

To join an organization, you must be invited by one of its [owners][] and must accept the emailed invitation. Refer to [Organization Settings: Users](#users) for details.

You can leave an organization from your user account settings. Refer to [User Settings: Organizations](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#organizations) for details.

## Creating Organizations

On Terraform Enterprise, administrators can restrict your ability to create organizations. Refer to [Administration: General Settings](/enterprise/admin/application/general#organization-creation) for details.

On Terraform Cloud, any user can create a new organization. If you do not belong to any organizations, Terraform Cloud prompts you to create one the first time you log in. Otherwise, to create an organization:

1. Click the current organization name and select **Create new organization**. The **Create a new organization** page appears.
1. Enter a unique **Organization name** Organization names can include numbers, letters, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`).
1. Provide an **Email address** where you will receive notifictions about the organization.
1. Click **Create organization**.

Terraform Cloud shows the new organization in the navigation bar and prompts you to create a new workspace. You can also [invite other users](#users) to join the organization.


## Organization Settings

You can view and manage an organization's settings by clicking the "Settings" link in the top navigation bar.

![screenshot: the organization settings page](/img/docs/org-settings.png)

The contents of the organization settings depends on the current user's permissions within the organization:

- Users with permission to manage VCS settings or manage policies can manage the settings they have access to. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))
- [Organization owners][owners] can view and manage the entire list of organization settings. Most settings cannot be delegated, and are only available to owners.
- Other users can use this section to view the organization's contact email, view the membership of any teams they belong to, and view the organization's authentication policy.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Most of the organization settings are documented near the specific workflows they enable. What follows is a brief summary with links to more relevant sections of the documentation.

### General

The general settings page is shown to all users in an organization, and displays the organization's name and contact email.

Organization owners can use this page to change the organization's name and contact email or delete the organization.

#### Renaming an Organization

!> **Warning:** Renaming an organization can be very disruptive. With the exception of new organizations with no collaborators, we strongly recommend against renaming organizations.

To rename a new organization with few or no collaborators, make sure there are no runs in progress and then update the name on the general settings page. Renaming a brand new organization is generally harmless and non-disruptive.

To rename an organization that is already managing significant infrastructure, you must:

1. Alert all members of the organization ahead of time, so they're prepared for the disruption.
1. Lock all workspaces, and bring all current and pending runs to an end (by cancelling them or by waiting for them to finish). For your protection, Terraform Cloud won't change the name of an organization with runs in progress; locking workspaces ensures no new runs will start before you attempt to change the name.
1. Rename the organization.
1. Update anything that uses Terraform Cloud's API with the organization to use its new name. This includes Terraform's `remote` backend, the `tfe` Terraform provider, and any external API integrations.
1. Unlock workspaces and resume normal operations.

### Plan & Billing

The plan and billing page allows organization owners to upgrade to one of Terraform Cloud's paid plans, downgrade to a free plan, or begin a free trial of paid features. It also displays any invoices for previous plan payments.

### Tags

This page shows the list of tags used for all resources across the organization. Tags can be added directly to workspaces. Tags deleted here will be removed from all other resources, and can be deleted in bulk.

![Screenshot: the tags list, showing a list of currently used tags.](/img/docs/tag-management.png)

### Teams

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team** upgrade package. Free organizations only include an owners team, which can include up to five members. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

The teams page is shown to all users in an organization.

Organization owners can use this page to create and delete teams, manage team membership, and manage team API tokens. Note that users can only be added to teams after they have received and accepted an invitation to the organization.

Non-owners can view the list of teams (excluding [secret teams](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#team-visibility) they aren't members of), view the membership of those teams, and manage team API tokens for those teams. They can't edit team memberships.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

See [Teams][] for more information.

### Users

The users page allows organization owners to invite new Terraform Cloud users into the organization, cancel invitations, and remove existing members.

The list of users is split into two tabs: one for currently active users, and one for invited users who haven't accepted their invitations yet. If the lists are large, you can filter them by username or email using the search field at the top. For active users, the list includes usernames, email addresses, avatar icons, two-factor authentication status, and current team memberships.

![Screenshot: the users list, showing information for the currently active users.](/img/docs/org-users.png)

To invite a user to an organization, click the "Invite a user" button on the "Users" page. You will be asked to provide an email address and an optional list of teams. If the user accepts the emailed invitation, they will be automatically added to the specified teams.

![Screenshot: the "Invite a user" dialog, which includes fields for email address and teams.](/img/docs/org-users-invite.png)

User invitations are always sent by email; you cannot invite someone using their Terraform Cloud username.

-> **Note:** All permissions in Terraform Cloud are managed via teams. Although users can join an organization without belonging to any teams, they won't be able to do anything until they are also added to a team. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

### Variable Sets

Variable sets allow you to reuse the same variables across multiple workspaces in the organization. For example, you could define a variable set of provider credentials and automatically apply it to several workspaces, rather than manually defining credential variables in each. Changes to variable sets instantly apply to all appropriate workspaces, saving time and reducing errors from manual updates.

The **Variable Sets** page allows everyone in an organization to view all of the available variable sets and their variables. Users with [`read and write variables` permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#general-workspace-permissions) can also create variable sets and assign them to one or more workspaces.

Refer to the [variables overview](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables) documentation for more information about variable types, scope, and precedence. Refer to [managing variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables) for details about how to create and manage variable sets.

### API Tokens

Organizations can have a special API token that is not associated with a specific user or team. See [API Tokens](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens) for more information.

### Authentication

Available to members of the `owners` team. Determine when users must reauthenticate and require [two-factor authentication](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/2fa) for all members of the organization.

### SSH Keys

Manage [SSH keys for cloning Git-based modules]((/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/ssh-keys)) during Terraform runs. This does not include keys to access a connected VCS provider.

### Cost Estimation

-> **Note:** Cost estimation is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** package. Refer to [Terraform pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

Enable and disable the [cost estimation](/cloud-docs/cost-estimation) feature for all workspaces.

### Policies

This is a deprecated interface for managing Sentinel policies. Use the policy sets page instead.

### Policy Sets

-> **Note:** Sentinel policies are a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** package. Refer to [Terraform pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

Create groups of [Sentinel policies](/cloud-docs/sentinel) from a connected VCS repository and assign those policy sets to workspaces. Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework that can enforce rules about Terraform runs within an organization. You must have [permission to manage policies](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions).

### Run Tasks

Manage the run tasks that you can add to workspaces within the organization. [Run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) let you integrate third-party tools and services at specific stages in the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle.

### VCS Providers

Configure [VCS providers](/cloud-docs/vcs) to use in the organization. You must have [permission to manage VCS settings](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions).

## Trial Expired Organizations

Terraform Cloud paid features are available as a free trial. If you are working with a HashiCorp Sales Representative, ask them how to get a free trial.

When a free trial has expired, the organization displays a banner reading **TRIAL EXPIRED — Upgrade Required** in the top navigation bar.

Organizations with expired trials return to the feature set of a free organization, but they retain any data created as part of paid features. Specifically, Terraform Cloud performs the following actions:

- Disables teams other than `owners` and locks users who do not belong to the `owners` team out of the organization. Terraform Cloud preserves team membership and permissions and re-enables them after you upgrade the organization.
- Disables Sentinel policy checks. Terraform Cloud preserves existing policies and policy sets and re-enables them after you upgrade the organization.
- Disables cost estimation.
