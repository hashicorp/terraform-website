# Teams

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team and Governance** plan. Free organizations only include an owners team with up to five members. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

Teams are groups of Terraform Cloud [users][] within an [organization][organizations]. If a user belongs to at least one team in an organization, they are considered a member of that organization.

The organization can [grant workspace permissions to teams](#managing-workspace-access) that allow its members to start Terraform runs, create workspace variables, read and write state, etc. Teams can only have permissions on workspaces within their organization, although individual users can belong to teams in other organizations.

## API and Terraform Enterprise Provider

In addition to the Terraform Cloud UI, you can use the following methods to manage teams:

- [Teams API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) to list, create, update, and delete teams
- [Team Members API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-members) to add and delete users from teams
- [Team Tokens API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-tokens) to generate and delete tokens
- [Team Access API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-access) to manage team access to one or more workspaces
- The `tfe` provider resources [`tfe_team`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/team), [`tfe_team_members`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/team_members), and [`tfe_team_access`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/team_access)

## The Owners Team

Every organization has a team named **owners**, and members of the owners team are sometimes called organization owners. An organization's creator is the first member of its owners team, you can add and remove other members in the same way as other teams. In free organizations, the owners team is limited to five members. In paid organizations, the size of the owners team is not limited.

Unlike other teams, you cannot delete the owners team or leave it empty. If there is only one member in an owners team, you must add another user before you can remove the current member.

Only organization owners can perform the following tasks:

- Creating and deleting teams
- Inviting users to the organization
- Managing team membership and organization-level permissions granted to teams
- Viewing the full list of teams, both visible and secret
- Managing [organization settings][]

Refer to [Organization Owners](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) for more details about owners team permissions.

## Managing Teams

Only organization owners can manage teams or view the full list of teams. Other users can view any teams marked as visible within the organization, plus any secret teams they
are members of. Refer to [Team Visibility](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#team-visibility) for details.

To manage teams:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Click a team to go to its settings page, which lists the team's settings and current members. Members that have [two-factor authentication](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/2fa) enabled have a **2FA** badge.

### Creating Teams

To create a new team:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Enter a unique team **Name** and click **Create Team**. Team names can include numbers, letters, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`).

The new team's settings page appears, where you can add new members and grant permissions.

### Deleting Teams

~> **Important:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

To delete a team:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Click the team you want to delete to go to its settings page.
1. Click **Delete [team name]** at the bottom of the page. The **Deleting team "[team name]"** box appears.
1. Click **Yes, delete team** to permanently delete the team and all of its data from Terraform Cloud.

### Managing Team Membership

Team structure often resembles your company's organizational structure. Refer to the [Terraform Recommended Practices guide](/cloud-docs/guides/recommended-practices) for a discussion of how team structure interacts with the structure of your Terraform configurations and the corresponding infrastructure.

#### Add Users

If the user is not yet in the organization, [invite them to join the organization](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#users) and include a list of teams they should belong to in the invitation. Once the user accepts the invitation, Terraform Cloud automatically adds them to those teams.

To add a user that is already in the organization:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Click the team to go to its settings page.
1. Choose a user under **Add a New Team Member**. Use the text field to filter the list by username or email.
1. Click the user to add them to the team. The user is now listed under **Members**.

#### Remove users

To remove a user from a team:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Click the team to go to its settings page.
1. Click the **ellipses (...)** next to the user's name and select **Remove from team**. Terraform Cloud removes the user from the list of team members.

### Team Visibility

Visibility controls who can see a team within the organization. To edit a team's visibility:

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation bar, and then click **Teams** in the sidebar. The **Team Management** page appears, containing a list of all teams within the organization.
1. Click the team to go to its settings page.
1. Choose a **Visibility** setting:
   - **Visible:** Every user in the organization can see the
  team and its membership. Non-members have read-only access.
   - **Secret:** Only team members and organization owners can read a team and its membership. This is the default setting.

We recommend making most (or all) teams visible to simplify workspace administration. Secret teams should only have
[organization-level permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions), since workspace admins cannot manage permissions for teams they cannot view.

### API Tokens

Each team can have an API token that is not associated with a specific user. You can manage this API token from the team's settings page under **Team API Token** . Refer to [Team API Tokens](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens) for details.

## Managing Workspace Access

You can grant teams various permissions on workspaces. Refer to [Workspace Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions) for details.

 Terraform Cloud uses the highest permission level from your teams to determine what actions you can take on a particular resource. For example, if you belong to a team that only has permission to read runs for a workspace and another team with admin access to that workspace, Terraform Cloud grants you admin access.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

[Organization-level permissions](cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) can also supersede lower workspace permissions. For example, if a team only has permission to read runs for a given workspace but also has permission to manage workspaces for the organization, members of that team have admin access to the workspace. Conversely, if the team has permission to manage policies for the organization (which gives permission to read runs for all workspaces) and also has admin access to a specific workspace, Terraform Cloud grants the higher admin permission level on that workspace.

To manage team permissions on a workspace:

1. Go to the workspace and click **Settings > Team Access**. The **Team Access** page appears.
1. Click **Add team and permissions** to select a team and assign a pre-built or custom permission set.

## Managing Organization Access

Organization owners can grant teams permissions to manage policies, workspaces, VCS settings, private registry providers and modules, and policy overrides across an organization. Refer to [Organization Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) for details.
