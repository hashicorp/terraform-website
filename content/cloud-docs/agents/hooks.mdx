# Hooks

Terraform Cloud Agents support executing custom programs, or hooks, during strategic points of a Terraform run. These hooks allow operators to extend the functionality of Terraform runs.

The following hooks are supported:

- `pre-plan` - This hook executes before `terraform init` during a `plan` operation.

- `post-plan` - This hook executes after `terraform plan` during a `plan` operation regardless whether or not `terraform plan` successfully executed.

- `pre-apply` - This hook executes before `terraform init` during an `apply` operation.

- `post-apply` - This hook executes after `terraform apply` during an `apply` operation regardless whether or not `terraform apply` successfully executed.

## Configuration

Hooks are stored within the `hooks` subdirectory of the agent's data directory. By default, that's `~/.tfc-agent/hooks`.

To enable a hook, create a file named `terraform-${HOOK}` where `${HOOK}` is one of the hooks listed above. Then store that file within the `hooks` subdirectory and make it executable. Once an agent is started and receives a run, it will attempt to execute your hook at the specified point during the Terraform run.

For example, a `pre-plan` hook is an executable file named `~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan`.

### Configuring hooks when running an Agent as a binary

When running the `tfc-agent` binary directly on a Linux instance, you need to
create the `hooks` directory within the agent's data directory.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.tfc-agent/hooks
```

Then create your hooks. Here, a `pre-plan` hook is being created.

```sh
cat <<EOF > ~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan
#!/bin/bash
echo "Example pre-plan hook."
EOF
```

Don't forget to make the hooks executable!

```sh
chmod +x ~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan
```

Finally, start the agent.

```sh
tfc-agent
```

That's it! As the agent executes Terraform runs it will attempt to execute
your enabled hooks.

### Configuring hooks when running an Agent using Docker 

When running `tfc-agent` using Docker, you need to build a new Docker image
containing your hooks.

First, create a new directory and change into it. This allows the Docker
build context to be limited to this new directory.

```sh
mkdir hooks-docker-example
cd hooks-docker-example
```

Then, create a `hooks` directory to hold your hooks.

```sh
mkdir hooks
```

Next, create your hooks. Here, a `pre-plan` hook is being created.

```sh
cat <<EOF > hooks/terraform-pre-plan
#!/bin/bash
echo "Example pre-plan hook."
EOF
```

Don't forget to make the hooks executable!

```sh
chmod +x hooks/terraform-pre-plan
```

Build a new `hashicorp/tfc-agent` Docker image using this `Dockerfile`.

```
FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest
RUN mkdir /home/tfc-agent/.tfc-agent
ADD --chown=tfc-agent:tfc-agent hooks /home/tfc-agent/.tfc-agent/hooks
```

Start the agent using your newly built Docker image.

```sh
docker run -e TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=your-token -e TFC_AGENT_NAME=your-agent-name \
  hashicorp/tfc-agent:your-tag
```

That's it! As the agent executes Terraform runs it will attempt to execute your
enabled hooks.
