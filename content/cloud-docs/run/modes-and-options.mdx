# Run Modes and Options

Terraform Cloud runs support many of the same modes and options available in the Terraform CLI.

## Destroy Mode

[Destroy mode](/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) instructs Terraform to create a plan which destroys all objects, regardless of configuration changes.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -destroy` or `terraform destroy`
- **API:** Use the `is-destroy` option.
- **UI:** Use a workspace's "Destruction and Deletion" settings page.

## Refresh-Only Mode

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Use Refresh-Only Mode to Sync Terraform State](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/refresh) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

-> **Version note:** Refresh-only support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later and requires a workspace using at least Terraform CLI v0.15.4.

[Refresh-only mode](/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) instructs Terraform to create a plan which updates the Terraform state to match changes made to remote objects outside of Terraform.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -refresh-only` or `terraform apply -refresh-only`.
- **API:** Use the `refresh-only` option.
- **UI:** Use the "Start new plan" action from a workspace's "Actions" menu, then choose the "Refresh-only" plan type in the new plan dialog.

## Skipping Automatic State Refresh

-> **Version note:** The ability to skip automatic state refresh is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later.

The [`-refresh=false` option](/cli/commands/plan#refresh-false) is used in normal planning mode to skip the default behavior of refreshing Terraform state before checking for configuration changes.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -refresh=false` or `terraform apply -refresh=false`.
- **API:** Use the `refresh` option.

## Replacing Selected Resources

-> **Version note:** Replace support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later and requires a workspace using at least Terraform CLI v0.15.2.

The [replace option](/cli/commands/plan#replace-address) instructs Terraform to replace the object with the given resource address.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -replace=ADDRESS` or `terraform apply -replace=ADDRESS`.
- **API:** Use the `replace-addrs` option.

## Allow Empty Apply

A no-operation (empty) apply enables Terraform Cloud to apply a run from a plan that contains no infrastructure changes. During apply, Terraform can upgrade the state version if required. You can use this option to upgrade the state in your Terraform Cloud workspace to a new Terraform version.

~> **Warning:** Terraform Cloud cannot guarantee that a plan in this mode will produce no changes. We recommend checking the plan for drift before proceeding to the apply stage.

- **API:** Set the `allow-empty-apply` field to `true`.
- **UI:** Use the "Start new plan" action from a workspace's "Actions" menu, then select the "Allow empty apply" option in the new plan dialog.

## Plan Only/Speculative Plan

The Plan Only option creates a plan that Terraform cannot apply. Plan Only runs are also known as [Speculative plans](/cloud-docs/run#speculative-plans). They show a set of possible changes and check them against Sentinel policies, but those changes cannot be applied. You can use it to test a specific Terraform version that may differ from the workspace version. This lets you check whether your configuration is compatible with a newer terraform version without changing the workspace settings.

- **API:** Set the `plan-only` field to `true` and specify an available terraform version using the `terraform-version` field.
- **UI:** Open the workspace's **Actions** menu, select **Start new plan**, and then choose **Plan only** as the run type.

## Targeted Plan and Apply

-> **Version note:** Targeting support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202006-1 or later.

[Resource Targeting](/cli/commands/plan#resource-targeting) is intended for exceptional circumstances only and should not be used routinely.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -target=ADDRESS` or `terraform apply -target=ADDRESS`.
- **API:** Use the `target-addrs` option.

The usual caveats for targeting in local operations imply some additional limitations on Terraform Cloud features for remote plans created with targeting:

- [Sentinel](/cloud-docs/sentinel) policy checks for targeted plans will see only the selected subset of resource instances planned for changes in [the `tfplan` import](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfplan) and [the `tfplan/v2` import](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfplan-v2), which may cause an unintended failure for any policy that requires a planned change to a particular resource instance selected by its address.

- [Cost Estimation](/cloud-docs/cost-estimation) is disabled for any run created with `-target` set, to prevent producing a misleading underestimate of cost due to resource instances being excluded from the plan.

You can disable or constrain use of targeting in a particular workspace using a Sentinel policy based on [the `tfrun.target_addrs` value](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfrun#value-target_addrs).
