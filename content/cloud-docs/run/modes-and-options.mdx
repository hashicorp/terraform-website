# Run Modes and Options

Terraform Cloud runs support many of the same modes and options available in the Terraform CLI.

## Destroy Mode

[Destroy mode](/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) instructs Terraform to create a plan which destroys all objects, regardless of configuration changes.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -destroy` or `terraform destroy`
- **API:** Use the `is-destroy` option.
- **UI:** Use a workspace's "Destruction and Deletion" settings page.

## Refresh-Only Mode

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Use Refresh-Only Mode to Sync Terraform State](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/refresh) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

-> **Version note:** Refresh-only support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later and requires a workspace using at least Terraform CLI v0.15.4.

[Refresh-only mode](/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) instructs Terraform to create a plan which updates the Terraform state to match changes made to remote objects outside of Terraform.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -refresh-only` or `terraform apply -refresh-only`.
- **API:** Use the `refresh-only` option.
- **UI:** Use the "Start new plan" action from a workspace's "Actions" menu, then choose the "Refresh-only" plan type in the new plan dialog.

## Skipping Automatic State Refresh

-> **Version note:** The ability to skip automatic state refresh is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later.

The [`-refresh=false` option](/cli/commands/plan#refresh-false) is used in normal planning mode to skip the default behavior of refreshing Terraform state before checking for configuration changes.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -refresh=false` or `terraform apply -refresh=false`.
- **API:** Use the `refresh` option.

## Replacing Selected Resources

-> **Version note:** Replace support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1 or later and requires a workspace using at least Terraform CLI v0.15.2.

The [replace option](/cli/commands/plan#replace-address) instructs Terraform to replace the object with the given resource address.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -replace=ADDRESS` or `terraform apply -replace=ADDRESS`.
- **API:** Use the `replace-addrs` option.

## Allow Empty Apply

A no-operation (empty) apply enables Terraform Cloud to apply a run that produces no changes rather than simply finishing after the plan stage. Empty applies are particularly useful for users wishing to upgrade a Terraform Cloud workspace's latest state version to the desired Terraform version.

-> **Note:** Terraform Cloud cannot guarantee that a plan in this mode will produce no changes and so it is advised to check for resource drift beforehand.

- **API:** Set the `allow-empty-apply` field to `true`.
- **UI:** Use the "Start new plan" action from a workspace's "Actions" menu, then select the "Allow empty apply" option in the new plan dialog.

## Plan Only

A plan-only run is a way to create an un-apply-able plan using a specific terraform version that may differ from the workspace version. This is useful when checking if your configuration is upgradable to a newer terraform version without changing the workspace settings first.

- **API:** Set the `plan-only` field to `true` and specify an available terraform version using the `terraform-version` field.
- **UI:** Use the "Start new plan" action from a workspace's "Actions" menu, then select the "Plan only" option in the new plan dialog.

## Targeted Plan and Apply

-> **Version note:** Targeting support is available in Terraform Enterprise v202006-1 or later.

[Resource Targeting](/cli/commands/plan#resource-targeting) is intended for exceptional circumstances only and should not be used routinely.

- **CLI:** Use `terraform plan -target=ADDRESS` or `terraform apply -target=ADDRESS`.
- **API:** Use the `target-addrs` option.

The usual caveats for targeting in local operations imply some additional limitations on Terraform Cloud features for remote plans created with targeting:

- [Sentinel](/cloud-docs/sentinel) policy checks for targeted plans will see only the selected subset of resource instances planned for changes in [the `tfplan` import](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfplan) and [the `tfplan/v2` import](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfplan-v2), which may cause an unintended failure for any policy that requires a planned change to a particular resource instance selected by its address.

- [Cost Estimation](/cloud-docs/cost-estimation) is disabled for any run created with `-target` set, to prevent producing a misleading underestimate of cost due to resource instances being excluded from the plan.

You can disable or constrain use of targeting in a particular workspace using a Sentinel policy based on [the `tfrun.target_addrs` value](/cloud-docs/sentinel/import/tfrun#value-target_addrs).
