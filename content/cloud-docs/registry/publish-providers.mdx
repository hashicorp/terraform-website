# Publishing Private Providers to the Terraform Cloud Private Registry

In addition to [curating public providers from the Terraform Registry](/cloud-docs/registry/add), you can publish private providers to an organization's Terraform Cloud private registry. Once you have published a private provider through the API, members of your organization can search for it in the private registry UI and use it in configurations.

-> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise does not support private providers.

## Requirements

When publishing a provider, you must upload one or more provider binaries and assets for validation (e.g., signing key, `SHA256SUMS` file, etc.). Review the following before publishing a new provider.

### Permissions

You must be a member of the [owners team](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) or a team with [Manage Private Registry permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-private-registry) to publish and delete private providers from the private registry.

### Release Files

You must publish at least one version of your provider that follows [semantic versioning format](http://semver.org). For each version, you must upload the `SHA256SUMS` file, `SHA256SUMS.sig` file, and one or more provider binaries. Using GoReleaser to [create a release on GitHub](/registry/providers/publishing#creating-a-github-release) or [create a release locally](/registry/providers/publishing#using-goreleaser-locally) generates these files automatically. The private registry does not have strict naming conventions, but we recommend using GoReleaser file naming schemes for consistency.

Private providers do not currently support documentation.

### Signed Releases

GPG signing is required for custom providers, and you must upload the public key of the GPG keypair used to sign the release. Refer to [Preparing and Adding a Signing Key](/registry/providers/publishing#preparing-and-adding-a-signing-key) for more details. Unlike the public Terraform Registry, the private registry does not automatically upload new releases. You must manually add new provider versions and the associated release files.

## Publishing a Provider and Creating a Version

You must create a provider, at least one version, and at least one platform before consumers can use your provider in configurations. Before you begin, confirm that you can access the provider binaries, public GPG signing key, `SHA256SUMS` file, and `SHA256SUMS.sig` file from at least one release. You will upload these artifacts in the following steps.

To publish a new provider through the Terraform Cloud API:

1. Use the [Upload a GPG key endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers#upload-a-gpg-key-private-provider) to add the public key that matches the signing key for the release. The response contains a `key-id` that you will use to create a provider version.

    ```json
    "key-id": "32966F3FB5AC1129"
    ```
1. Use the [Create a Provider Version endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers#create-a-provider-version) to create a version with the `key-id` from the previous step. The response includes URL links that you will use to upload the `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256.sig` files.

    ```json
    "links": {
        "shasums-upload":     "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b64hd73ghd63",
        "shasums-sig-upload": "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b37dj37dh33d"
      }
    ```

1. Upload the `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` files to the URLs returned in the previous step. The example command below uploads the files from a local machine.

    ```
    $ curl -T local-example/terraform-provider-random_3.1.3_SHA256SUMS
      https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b64hd73ghd63
    ```

1. Use the [Upload a Provider Platform](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers#upload-a-provider-platform-private-provider) endpoint to create a platform for the release. Platforms are binaries that allow the provider to run on a particular operating system and architecture combination (e.g., Linux and AMD64). The response includes a `provider-binary-upload` URL that you will use to upload the binary file for the platform.

    ```json
    "links": {
          "provider-binary-upload": "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b45c367djh45nj78"
        }
    ```

1. Upload the platform binary file to the URL from the previous step. The example command below uploads the binary from a local machine.

    ```
    $ curl -T local-example/terraform-provider-random_3.1.3_linux_amd64.zip
      https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b45c367djh45nj78
    ```

1. (Optional) Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add additional platform binaries for the release.

The provider is available in your organizationâ€™s Terraform Cloud private registry. Users can search for it in the private registry UI and begin using it in configurations.

## Checking Release Files

Consumers cannot use a private provider until you upload all required [release files](#release-files). To determine whether these files have been uploaded:

1. Click **Registry** in the top navigation bar and click the private provider to go to its details page.
1. Open the **Manage Provider** menu and select **View release files**. The **Release Files** page appears containing lists of uploaded and missing files for the version.


## Managing Private Providers

Use the [Registry Providers API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers) to do the following:

- Add and view GPG keys
- Add, update, and delete provider versions and platforms
- Publish and update providers

## Deleting Private Providers.

You can delete private providers through the [Registry Providers API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers) or through the Terraform Cloud UI. To delete providers through the UI:

1. Click **Registry** in the top navigation bar and click the private provider to go to its details page.
If you want to delete a single version, use the **Versions** menu to select it.
1. Open the **Manage Provider** menu and select **Delete Provider**. The **Delete Provider** box appears.
1. Select an action from the menu:

    - **Delete only this provider version:** Deletes only the version of the provider you were viewing when you clicked **Delete Provider**.
    - **Delete all versions for this provider:** Deletes the entire provider and all associated versions.
1. Type the provider name and click **Delete**.

Your provider has been deleted from this organization's private registry and all of its data has been removed. Consumers will no longer be able to reference this provider in configurations.

### Restoring a Deleted Provider

Deletion is permanent, but you can restore a deleted private provider by re-adding it to your organization and recreating its versions and platforms.
