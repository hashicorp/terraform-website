# Publishing Private Providers to the Terraform Cloud Private Registry

In addition to [curating public providers from the Terraform Registry](/cloud-docs/registry/add), you can publish private providers to an organization's Terraform Cloud private registry. Once you have published a private provider through the API, members of your organization can search for it in the private registry UI and use it in their configuration.

-> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise does not support private providers.

## Publishing Requirements

When publishing a provider, you must upload one or more provider binaries, and assets for validation (e.g., signing key, `SHA256SUMS` file, etc.). Review the following before publishing a new provider.

### Permissions

You must be a member of the [owners team](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) or a team with [Manage Private Registry permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-private-registry) to publish and delete private providers from the private registry.

### Release Artifacts

You must publish at least one version of your provider that follows [semantic versioning format](http://semver.org). For each version, you must upload the signing key, `SHA256SUMS` file, `SHA256SUMS.sig` file, and one or more provider binaries. Using GoReleaser to [create a release on GitHub](/registry/providers/publishing#creating-a-github-release) or [create a release locally](/registry/providers/publishing#using-goreleaser-locally) generates many of these artifacts automatically. The private registry does not have strict naming conventions, but we recommend using GoReleaser file naming schemes for consistency.

Private providers do not currently support documentation.

### Signed Releases

GPG signing is required for custom providers, and you must upload the public key of the GPG keypair used to sign the release. Refer to [Preparing and Adding a Signing Key](/registry/providers/publishing#preparing-and-adding-a-signing-key) for more details. Unlike the public Terraform Registry, the private registry does not automatically upload new releases. You must manually add new provider versions.

## Publishing a New Provider

You can publish and manage private providers through the Terraform Cloud API. Before you begin, confirm that you can access the provider binaries, public GPG signing key, `SHA256SUMS` file, and `SHA256SUMS.sig` file from at least one release. You will upload these artifacts in the following steps.

To publish a new provider:

1. Use the [Add a GPG key endpoint](link to endpoint) to add the public key that matches the signing key for the release. The response contains a `key-id` that you will use to create a provider version.

    ```json
    "key-id": "32966F3FB5AC1129"
    ```
1. Use the [Create a Provider Version endpoint](link to endpoint) to create a version with the `key-id` from the previous step. The response includes URL links that you will use to upload the `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256.sig` files.

    ```json
    "links": {
        "shasums-upload":     "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b64hd73ghd63",
        "shasums-sig-upload": "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b37dj37dh33d"
      }
    ```

1. Upload the `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` files to the URLs returned in the previous step. The example command below uploads the files from a local machine.

    ```
    $ curl -T local-example/terraform-provider-random_3.1.3_SHA256SUMS
      https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b64hd73ghd63
    ```

1. Use the [Add a Provider Platform endpoint](link to endpoint) to create a platform for the release. Platforms are binaries that allow the provider to run on a particular operating system and architecture combination (e.g., Linux and AMD64). The response includes a `provider-binary-upload` URL that you will use to upload the binary file for the platform.

    ```json
    "links": {
          "provider-binary-upload": "https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b45c367djh36dh3"
        }
    ```

1. Upload the platform binary file to the URL from the previous step. The example command below uploads the binary from a local machine.

    ```
    $ curl -T local-example/terraform-provider-random_3.1.3_linux_amd64.zip
      https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/dmF1b45c367djh36dh3
    ```

1. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add additional required platform binaries for the release.

The provider is now available in your organizationâ€™s Terraform Cloud private registry. Users can search for it in the private registry UI and begin using it in configurations.

## Managing Private Providers

Use the [Registry Providers API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers) to do the following:

- View GPG keys
- Add and delete provider versions and platforms
- Publish, update, and delete private providers
