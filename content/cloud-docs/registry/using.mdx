# Using Providers and Modules from the Private Registry

All users in an organization can view the Terraform Cloud private registry and use the available providers and modules. A private registry has some key requirements and differences from the [public Terraform Registry](/registry):

- **Location:** You must use Terraform Cloud's web UI to search for providers, modules, and usage examples.
- **Provider and Module block `source` argument:** Private providers and modules use a [different format](/cloud-docs/registry/using#using-private-providers-and-modules-in-configurations).
- **Terraform version:** Terraform Cloud workspaces using version 0.11 and higher can automatically access your private modules during Terraform runs, and workspaces using version 0.13 and higher can also automatically access private providers.
- **Authentication:** If you run Terraform on the command line, you must [authenticate](/cloud-docs/registry/using#authentication) to Terraform Cloud or your Terraform Enterprise instance to use providers and modules in your organization’s private registry.


-> **Note:** Private providers are not available in Terraform Enterprise.

## Finding Providers and Modules

To find available providers and modules, click the **Registry** button in the main navigation bar. The **Registry** page appears.

Click **Providers** and **Modules** to toggle back and forth between lists of available providers and modules in the private registry. You can also use the search field to filter for titles that contain a specific keyword. The search does not include READMEs or resource details.

### Shared Modules - Terraform Enterprise

On Terraform Enterprise, your [module sharing](/enterprise/admin/application/module-sharing) configuration may grant you access to modules outside your organization. Modules that are shared with your current organization have a **Shared** badge in the private registry (below). Modules in your current organization that are shared with other organizations have a badge that says **Sharing**.

### Viewing Provider and Module Details and Versions

Click a provider or module to view its details page. Use the **Versions** menu in the upper right to switch between the available versions, and use the **Readme**, **Inputs**, **Outputs**, **Dependencies**, and **Resources** tabs to view more information about the selected version.

### Viewing Nested Modules and Examples

Use the **Submodules** menu to navigate to the detail pages for any nested modules. Use the **Examples** menu to navigate to the detail pages for any available example modules.

## Using Public Providers and Modules in Configurations

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Use Modules from the Registry](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-use?in=terraform/modules) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

The syntax for public providers in a private registry is the same as for providers that you use directly from the public Terraform Registry. The syntax for the [provider block](/language/providers/configuration#provider-configuration-1) `source` argument is `<NAMESPACE>/<PROVIDER_NAME>`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "4.0.0"
    }
  }
```

The syntax for referencing public modules in the [module block](/language/modules/syntax) `source` argument is `<NAMESPACE>/<MODULE_NAME>/<PROVIDER_NAME>`.

```hcl
module "subnets" {
  source  = "hashicorp/subnets/cidr"
  version = "1.0.0"
}
```

## Using Private Providers and Modules in Configurations

The syntax for referencing private providers in the [provider block](/language/providers/configuration#provider-configuration-1) `source` argument is `<HOSTNAME>/<NAMESPACE>/<PROVIDER_NAME>`. For the SaaS version of Terraform Cloud, the hostname is `app.terraform.io`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    random = {
      source = "app.terraform.io/demo-custom-provider/random"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
  }
```

The syntax for referencing private modules in the [module block](/language/modules/syntax) `source` argument is `<HOSTNAME>/<ORGANIZATION>/<MODULE_NAME>/<PROVIDER_NAME>`.

- **Hostname:** For the SaaS version of Terraform Cloud, use `app.terraform.io`. In Terraform Enterprise, use the hostname for your instance or the [generic hostname](/cloud-docs/registry/using#generic-hostname-terraform-enterprise).
- **Organization:** If you are using a shared module with Terraform Enterprise, the module's organization name may be different from your organization's name. Check the source string at the top of the module's registry page to find the proper organization name.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "app.terraform.io/example_corp/vpc/aws"
  version = "1.0.4"
}
```


### Generic Hostname - Terraform Enterprise

You can use the generic hostname `localterraform.com` in module sources to reference modules without modifying the Terraform Enterprise instance. When you run Terraform, it automatically requests any `localterraform.com` modules from the Terraform Enterprise instance.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "localterraform.com/example_corp/vpc/aws"
  version = "1.0.4"
}
```

~> **Important:** The generic hostname only works within a Terraform Enterprise instance.

To test configurations on a developer workstation without the remote backend configured, you must replace the generic hostname with a literal hostname in all module sources and then change them back before committing to VCS. We are working on making this workflow smoother, but we currently only recommend `localterraform.com` for large organizations that use multiple Terraform Enterprise instances.

### Provider and Module Availability

A workspace can only use private providers and modules from its own organization's registry. When using providers or modules from multiple organizations in the same configuration, we recommend:

- **Terraform Cloud:** [Add providers and modules to the registry](/cloud-docs/registry/publish#sharing-modules-across-organizations) for each organization that requires access.

- **Terraform Enterprise:** Check your site's [module sharing](/enterprise/admin/application/module-sharing) configuration. Note that in Terraform Enterprise v202012-1 or higher, workspaces can also use private modules from organizations that are sharing modules with the workspace's organization. Private providers are not available in Terraform Enterprise.

## Running Configurations with Private Providers and Modules

### Version Requirements

Terraform version 0.11 or later is required to use private modules in Terraform cloud workspaces and to use the CLI to apply configurations with private modules. Terraform version 0.13 and later is required to use private providers in Terraform Cloud workspaces and apply configurations with private providers.


### Authentication

To authenticate with Terraform Cloud, you can use either a [user token](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or a [team token](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens). The type of token you choose may grant different permissions.

- **User Token**: Allows you to access providers and modules from any organization in which you are a member. You are a member of an organization if you belong to any team in that organization. In Terraform Enterprise v202012-1 or higher, you can also access modules from any organization that is sharing modules with any of your organizations.

 -> **Note:** When SAML SSO is enabled, there is a [session timeout for user API tokens](/enterprise/user-management/saml/login#api-token-expiration), requiring you to periodically re-authenticate through the web UI. Expired tokens produce a _401 Unauthorized_ error. A SAML SSO account with [IsServiceAccount](/enterprise/user-management/saml/attributes#isserviceaccount) is treated as a service account and will not have the session timeout.

- **Team Token**: Allows you to access the private registry of that team's organization and the registries from any other organizations that have configured sharing.


_Permissions Example_

A user belongs to three organizations (1, 2, and 3), and organizations 1 and 2 share access with each other. In this case, the user's token gives them access to the private registries for all of the organizations they belong to: 1, 2, and 3. However, a team token from a team in organization 1 only gives the user access to the private registry in organizations 1 and 2.

#### Configure Authentication

To configure authentication to Terraform Cloud or your Terraform Enterprise instance, you can:

- (Terraform 0.12.21 or later) Use the [`terraform login`](/cli/commands/login) command to obtain and save a user API token.
- Create a token and [manually configure credentials in the CLI config file][cli-credentials].

Make sure the hostname matches the hostname you use in provider and module sources because if the same Terraform Cloud server is available at two hostnames, Terraform will not know that they reference the same server. To support multiple hostnames for provider and module sources, use the `terraform login` command multiple times and specify a different hostname each time.
