# Adding Public Providers and Modules to the Private Registry

You can add providers and modules from the public [Terraform Registry](/registry) to your Terraform Cloud private registry. The private registry stores a pointer to these public providers and modules so that you can view their data from within Terraform Cloud. This lets you clearly designate which public providers and modules are recommended for the organization and makes their supporting documentation and examples centrally accessible.

-> **Note:** Public providers and modules are available in Terraform Enterprise v202012-1 and later. Your instance must allow access to `registry.terraform.io` and `https://yy0ffni7mf-dsn.algolia.net/`.

You can add providers and modules through the UI as detailed below or through the [Registry Providers API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/providers) and the [Registry Modules API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/modules#create-a-module-with-no-vcs-connection-).

## Permissions

All members of an organization can view and use public providers and modules. Members of the [owners team](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) and teams with [Manage Private Registry permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-private-registry) can add and delete them from the private registry.

1. Click **Add to organization** in the dialog box. Members of your organization can now  begin using it from the private registry.

## Removing a Public Provider or Module

Removing a public provider or module from a private registry does not remove it from the public Terraform Registry. Users in the organization will still be able to use the removed provider or module without changing their configurations.

To remove a public provider or module from an organization's private registry:

1. Click **Registry** in the main navigation bar. The organization's private registry appears with a list of available providers and modules.

1. Select the provider or module to view its details, open the **Manage for Organization** menu, and click **Remove from organization** (providers) or **Delete module** (modules).

1. Enter the provider or module name in the dialog box to confirm and then click **Remove** (providers) or **Delete** (modules). The provider or module is removed from the organization's private registry.
