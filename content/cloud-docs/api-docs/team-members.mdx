# Team Membership API

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team** upgrade package. Free organizations can also use this API, but can only manage membership of their owners team. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

The Team Membership API is used to add or remove users from teams. The [Team API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) is used to create or destroy teams.

## Organization Membership

-> **Note:** To add users to a team, they must first be invited to join the organization by email, and accept the invitation. This ensures that you don't accidentally add the wrong person by mistyping a username. See [the Organization Memberships API documentation](/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-memberships) for more information.

## Add a User to Team

This method adds multiple users to a team. Both users and teams must already exist.

`POST /teams/:team_id/relationships/users`

| Parameter  | Description         |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `:team_id` | The ID of the team. |

### Request Body

This POST endpoint requires a JSON object with the following properties as a request payload.

Properties without a default value are required.

| Key path      | Type   | Default | Description                      |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `data[].type` | string |         | Must be `"users"`.               |
| `data[].id`   | string |         | The username of the user to add. |

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "users",
      "id": "myuser1"
    },

## Delete a User from Team

This method removes multiple users from a team. Both users and teams must already exist. This DOES NOT delete the user; it only removes them from this team.
