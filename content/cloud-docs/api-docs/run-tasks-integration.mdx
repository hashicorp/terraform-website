# Run Tasks Integration API

-> Note: Run tasks are available only as a beta feature, are subject to change, and not all customers will see this functionality in their Terraform Cloud organization.

[Run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) allow Terraform Cloud to interact with external systems at specific points in the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle.
This page lists the API endpoints used to trigger a run task and the expected response from the integration.

Refer to [run tasks](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run-tasks) for the API endpoints to create and manage run tasks within Terraform Cloud.

## Run Task Request

When a run reaches the appropriate phase and a run task is triggered, Terraform Cloud will send a request to the run task's URL.
The service receiving the run task request should respond with `200 OK`, or Terraform Cloud will retry to trigger the run task.

`POST :url`

| Parameter | Description                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `:url`    | The URL configured in the run task to send requests to. |

| Status  | Response | Reason                            |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| [200][] | Nothing  | Successfully submitted a run task |

### Request Body

### Request Headers

The POST request submits the following properties as the request headers.

|          Name          |                   Value                    |                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type`         | `application/json`                         | Specifies the type of data in the request body                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `User-Agent`           | `TFC/1.0 (+https://app.terraform.io; TFC)` | Identifies the request is coming from Terraform Cloud                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `X-TFC-Task-Signature` | string                                     | If the run task is configured with an [HMAC Key](cloud-docs/integrations/run-tasks#securing-your-run-task), this header contains the signed SHA512 sum of the request payload using the configured HMAC key. Otherwise, this is an empty string. |

## Run Task Callback

Once a run task request has been fulfilled by the external integration, the integration must call back into Terraform Cloud with the result. Terraform expects this callback within 10 minutes, or the request will be considered to have errored.

`PATCH :callback_url`

|    Parameter    |                           Description                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:callback_url` | The `task_result_callback_url` specified in the run task request. Typically `/task-results/:guid/callback`. |

| Status  |         Response          |                  Reason                  |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [200][] | Nothing                   | Successfully submitted a run task result |
| [401][] | [JSON API error object][] | Not authorized to perform action         |

### Request Body

The PATCH request submits a JSON object with the following properties as a request payload.

|         Key path          |  Type  |                                           Description                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data.type`               | string | Must be `"task-results"`.                                                                       |
| `data.attributes.status`  | string | The current status of the task. Only `passed` or `failed` indicate that the task has completed. |
| `data.attributes.message` | string | (Optional) A short message describing the status of the task.                                   |
| `data.attributes.url`     | string | (Optional) A URL where users can obtain more information about the task.                         |

Status values other than `passed` or `failed` are considered a partial update and will not complete the task within Terraform Cloud. An External Service could use this to send a `started` status with a URL so that a user could monitor the task at the External Service's website. The External Service can send another callback when the task completes.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "task-results",
    "attributes": {
      "status": "passed",
      "message": "4 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed",
      "url": "https://external.service.dev/terraform-plan-checker/run-i3Df5to9ELvibKpQ"
    }
  }
}
```

### Request Headers

The PATCH request must use the token supplied in the originating request (`access_token`) for [authentication](/cloud-docs/api-docs#authentication).
