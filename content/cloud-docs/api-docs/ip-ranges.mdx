# IP Ranges API

IP Ranges provides a list of Terraform Cloud's IP ranges. For more information about Terraform Cloud's IP ranges, view our documentation about [Terraform Cloud IP Ranges](/cloud-docs/architectural-details/ip-ranges).

## IP Ranges Payload

| Name            | Type  | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `api`           | array | List of IP ranges in [CIDR notation] used for connections from user site to Terraform Cloud APIs |
| `notifications` | array | List of IP ranges in [CIDR notation] used for notifications                                      |
| `sentinel`      | array | List of IP ranges in [CIDR notation] used for outbound requests from Sentinel policies           |
| `vcs`           | array | List of IP ranges in [CIDR notation] used for connecting to VCS providers                        |

-> **Note:** The IP ranges for each feature returned by the IP Ranges API may overlap. Additionally, these published ranges do not currently allow for execution of Terraform runs against local resources.

-> **Note:** Under normal circumstances, HashiCorp will publish any expected changes to Terraform Cloud's IP ranges at least 24 hours in advance of implementing them. This should allow sufficient time for users to update any connected systems to reflect the changes. In the event of an emergency outage or failover operation, it may not be possible to pre-publish these changes.

## Get IP Ranges

-> **Note:** The IP Ranges API does not require authentication

-> **Note:** This endpoint supports the [If-Modified-Since][] HTTP request header

`GET /meta/ip-ranges`

| Status  | Response           | Reason                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [200][] | `application/json` | The request was successful                                                                                     |
| [304][] | empty body         | The request was successful; IP ranges were not modified since the specified date in `If-Modified-Since` header |

### Sample Request
