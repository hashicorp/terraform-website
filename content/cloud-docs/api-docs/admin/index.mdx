# Terraform Enterprise Admin API Documentation

-> **Terraform Enterprise feature:** The admin API is exclusive to Terraform Enterprise, and can only be used by the admins and operators who install and maintain their organization's Terraform Enterprise instance.

-> These API endpoints are available in Terraform Enterprise as of version 201807-1.

Terraform Enterprise provides an API to allow administrators to configure and support their installation.

See the navigation sidebar for the list of available endpoints.

## Authentication

With the exception of the [user impersonation endpoints](/cloud-docs/api-docs/admin/users#impersonate-another-user), all requests must be authenticated with a bearer token belonging to a site administrator. Use the HTTP Header `Authorization` with the value `Bearer <token>`. This token can be generated or revoked on the [tokens tab of the user settings page](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens). In the context of the Admin API, your token has management access to all resources in the system.

For more information on authentication behavior, see [the API overview section](/cloud-docs/api-docs/#authentication).
