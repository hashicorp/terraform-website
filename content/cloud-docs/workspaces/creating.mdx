# Creating Workspaces

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Get Started - Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cloud-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

Workspaces organize infrastructure into meaningful groups. Create new workspaces whenever you need to manage a new collection of infrastructure resources. You can use the following methods to create workspaces:

- **Terraform Cloud UI:** [Create a Workspace](#create-a-workspace)
- **Workspaces API:** [Create a Workspace endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#create-a-workspace)
- **Terraform Enterprise Provider:** [`tfe_workspace` resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/workspace)

## Permissions

To create a workspace, you must be a member of a team with [manage workspaces permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-workspaces).

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

## Create a Workspace

[workdir]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#terraform-working-directory

[trigger]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#automatic-run-triggering

[branch]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#vcs-branch

[submodules]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#include-submodules-on-clone

The workspace creation process varies depending on the workflow you choose (e.g., CLI-driven). To create a workspace in the Terraform Cloud UI:

1. Click **Workspaces** in the top navigation bar to view a list of the workspaces within your organization.
1. Click **+ New Workspace**. The **Create a new Workspace** page appears.
1. Choose a workflow type: **Version control**, **CLI-driven**, or **API-driven**.
1. (Version control only) Choose an existing version control provider or configure a new one. Refer to [Connecting VCS Providers](/cloud-docs/vcs) for more details.
1. (Version control only) Choose a repository from the filterable list. The **Configure settings** page appears.

  -> **Note:** Depending on your provider, you may need to change which account's repositories are shown. If the repository is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the list and enter its ID in the text field.

1. Enter a **Workspace Name**. This defaults to the repository name, if applicable. The name must be unique within the organization and can include letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`). Refer to our [workspace naming recommendations](/cloud-docs/workspaces/naming).
1. Add an optional **Description** that will appear at the top of the workspace in the Terraform Cloud UI.

1. (Version control only) Open **Advanced options** to optionally configure the following additional settings:
   - [Terraform Working Directory][workdir]
   - [Automatic Run Triggering][trigger]
   - [VCS branch][branch]
   - [Include submodules on clone][submodules]

1. Click **Create workspace**.

For CLI and API-driven workspaces, the workspace overview page appears. For version control workspaces, the **Configure Terraform variables** page appears.

### Configure Terraform Variables (Version Control Only)

After you create a new workspace from a version control repository, Terraform Cloud scans its configuration files for [Terraform variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#terraform-variables) without default values and automatically creates those variables within the workspace. Terraform cannot perform successful runs until you set values for these variables.

Choose one of the following actions:

- To skip this step, click **Go to workspace overview**. Terraform Cloud still adds any Terraform variables without default values to the workspace. You can set values for these variables later from within the workspace.
- To configure variables, enter a value for each variable and click **Save variables**.

## After Creating a Workspace

If you have already configured all Terraform variables, we recommend [manually starting a run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs) to prepare VCS-driven workspaces. You may also want to do one or more of the following actions:

- [Upload configuration versions](/cloud-docs/workspaces/configurations#providing-configuration-versions): If you chose the API or CLI-Driven workflow, you must upload configuration versions for the workspace.
- [Edit environment variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables): Shell environment variables store credentials and customize Terraform's behavior.
- [Edit additional workspace settings](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings): This includes notifications, permissions, and run triggers to start runs automatically.
- [Learn more about running Terraform in your workspace](/cloud-docs/run): This includes how Terraform processes runs within the workspace, run modes, run states, etc.

### VCS Connection

If you connected a VCS repository to the workspace, Terraform Cloud automatically registers a webhook with your VCS provider. A workspace with no runs will not accept new runs from a VCS webhook, so you must [manually start at least one run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs).

After you have manually started a run, Terraform Cloud will automatically queue a plan for the workspace when new commits appear in the selected branch of the linked repository or someone opens a pull request on that branch. Refer to [Webhooks](/cloud-docs/vcs/#webhooks) for more details.
