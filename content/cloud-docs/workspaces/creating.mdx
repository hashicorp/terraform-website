# Creating Workspaces

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Get Started - Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cloud-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

Workspaces organize infrastructure into meaningful groups. Create new workspaces whenever you need to manage a new collection of infrastructure resources.

Each new workspace needs a unique name, and needs to know where its Terraform configuration will come from. Most commonly, the configuration comes from a connected version control repository. If you choose not to connect a repository, you'll need to upload configuration versions for the workspace using Terraform CLI or the API.

For more information about how configuration versions and connected repositories work, see [Terraform Configurations in Terraform Cloud Workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces/configurations).

-> **API:** See the [Create a Workspace endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#create-a-workspace) (`POST /organizations/:organization/workspaces`). <br/>
**Terraform:** See the `tfe` provider's [`tfe_workspace`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/workspace) resource.

## Required Permissions

New workspaces can be created by teams with permission to manage workspaces. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

## Configuring a New Workspace

[workdir]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#terraform-working-directory

[trigger]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#automatic-run-triggering

[branch]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#vcs-branch

[submodules]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#include-submodules-on-clone

The workspace creation process varies depending on your chosen workflow (e.g., VCS) and your organization's settings. After you create a new workspace, you can optionally specify values for undefined [Terraform variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#terraform-variables).

### Create a workspace

To create a new workspace:

1. [Navigate to the workspace list](/cloud-docs/workspaces/#listing-and-filtering-workspaces) and click the **+ New Workspace** button (near the top of the page).

1. Choose a VCS provider (or choose **No VCS connection**). The **Choose a repository** screen appears. This screen is skipped if you chose **No VCS connection**.

   -> **Note:** If you haven't added a VCS provider for your organization yet, choosing one here will prompt you to configure it. See [Connecting VCS Providers](/cloud-docs/vcs) for more information.

1. Choose a repository from the filterable list. The **Configure settings** screen appears.

   Some VCS providers limit the list's size. If a repository isn't listed, you can still choose it by name; scroll to the bottom of the list and enter its ID in the text field.

   -> **Note:** For some VCS providers, this list includes a drop-down menu for changing which account's repositories are shown. Other providers combine all available accounts into a single list.

1. Enter a name for the workspace. This defaults to the repository name, if applicable. The name must be unique within the organization, and can include letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`). See our [advice for useful workspace names](/cloud-docs/workspaces/naming).

1. Optionally, click the **Advanced options** link on the third screen to configure some additional version control settings. (These settings not shown if you chose **No VCS connection**.) For information about these settings, see:
   - [Terraform Working Directory][workdir]
   - [Automatic Run Triggering][trigger]
   - [VCS branch][branch]
   - [Include submodules on clone][submodules]

1. Click the **Create workspace** button to confirm creation. The **Configure Terraform variables** screen appears. You can set values for undefined [Terraform variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#terraform-variables) within the configuration or click the **Go to workspace overview** button to skip this step.

### Configure Variables (Optional)

Click the **Go to workspace overview** button to skip this step and instead [edit variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#edit-a-variable) on the workspace **Variables** page. Terraform cannot complete runs until you enter values for those variables. To configure variables:

1. Enter values for [Terraform variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#terraform-variables) identified within the configuration.

1. Click the **Save variables** button.

1. Click the **Start new plan** button if you're ready to queue a plan. If you're not, click the **Go to workspace overview** button.

## After Creating a Workspace

Terraform Cloud presents a dialog with shortcut links to either queue a plan or edit variables. If you don't need to edit variables, [manually queue a run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs) to prepare your workspace.

You may also want to:

- [Edit input or environment variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables): Input variables define the parameters of a Terraform configuration, and shell environment variables store credentials and customize Terraform's behavior.
- [Edit additional workspace settings](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings): This includes notifications, permissions, and **Run Triggers** to queue runs automatically.
- [Learn more about running Terraform in your workspace](/cloud-docs/run): You can use the UI, API, or CLI to manage infrastructure.

### VCS Connection

If you connected a VCS repository to the workspace, Terraform Cloud automatically registers a webhook with your VCS provider. A workspace with no runs will not accept new runs from a VCS webhook, so you must [manually queue at least one run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs).

After you have manually queued a run, Terraform Cloud will automatically queue a plan for the workspace when new commits appear in the selected branch of the linked repository or someone opens a pull request on that branch. [Learn more about VCS webhooks](/cloud-docs/vcs/#webhooks).
