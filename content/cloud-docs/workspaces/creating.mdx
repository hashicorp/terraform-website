# Creating Workspaces

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Get Started - Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cloud-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

Workspaces organize infrastructure into meaningful groups. Create new workspaces whenever you need to manage a new collection of infrastructure resources.

Each new workspace needs a unique name, and needs to know where its Terraform configuration will come from. Most commonly, the configuration comes from a connected version control repository. If you choose not to connect a repository, you'll need to upload configuration versions for the workspace using Terraform CLI or the API.

For more information about how configuration versions and connected repositories work, see [Terraform Configurations in Terraform Cloud Workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces/configurations).

-> **API:** Refer to the [Create a Workspace endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#create-a-workspace) (`POST /organizations/:organization/workspaces`). <br/>
**Terraform:** Refer to the `tfe` provider's [`tfe_workspace`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/workspace) resource.

## Permissions

To create a new workspace, you must be a member of a team with [manage workspaces permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-workspaces).

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

## Create a Workspace

[workdir]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#terraform-working-directory

[trigger]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#automatic-run-triggering

[branch]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#vcs-branch

[submodules]: /cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#include-submodules-on-clone

The workspace creation process varies depending on the workflow you choose. To create a new workspace:

1. Click **Workspaces** in the top navigation bar to view a list of the workspaces within your organization.
1. Click **+ New Workspace**. The **Create a new Workspace** page appears.
1. Choose a workflow type: **Version control**, **CLI-driven**, or **API-driven**.
1. (Version control only) Choose an existing version control provider or configure a new one. Refer to [Connecting VCS Providers](/cloud-docs/vcs) for more details.
1. (Version control only) Choose a repository from the filterable list. The **Configure settings** page appears.

  -> **Note:** Depending on your provider, you may need to change which account's repositories are shown. If the repository is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the list and enter its ID in the text field.

1. Enter a **Workspace Name**. This defaults to the repository name, if applicable. The name must be unique within the organization and can include letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`). Refer to our [workspace naming recommendations](/cloud-docs/workspaces/naming).
1. Add an optional **Description** that will appear at the top of the workspace in the Terraform Cloud UI.

1. (Version control only) Open **Advanced options** to optionally configure the following additional settings:
   - [Terraform Working Directory][workdir]
   - [Automatic Run Triggering][trigger]
   - [VCS branch][branch]
   - [Include submodules on clone][submodules]

1. Click **Create workspace**.

For CLI and API-driven workspaces, the workspace overview page appears. For version control workspaces, the **Configure Terraform variables** page appears.

### Configure Terraform Variables (Version Control Only)

After you create a new workspace from a version control respository, Terraform Cloud scans the Terraform configuration files in that repository for [Terraform variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#terraform-variables). It automatically creates those variables within the workspace. Terraform cannot perform successful runs until you set values for all undefined variables.

Choose one of the following actions:

- To skip this step, click **Go to workspace overview**. You can set values for these variables later within the workspace.
- To configure variables, enter a value for each variable and click **Save variables**.

## After Creating a Workspace

Terraform Cloud presents a dialog with shortcut links to either queue a plan or edit variables. If you don't need to edit variables, [manually queue a run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs) to prepare your workspace.

You may also want to:

- [Edit input or environment variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables): Input variables define the parameters of a Terraform configuration, and shell environment variables store credentials and customize Terraform's behavior.
- [Edit additional workspace settings](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings): This includes notifications, permissions, and **Run Triggers** to queue runs automatically.
- [Learn more about running Terraform in your workspace](/cloud-docs/run): You can use the UI, API, or CLI to manage infrastructure.

### VCS Connection

If you connected a VCS repository to the workspace, Terraform Cloud automatically registers a webhook with your VCS provider. A workspace with no runs will not accept new runs from a VCS webhook, so you must [manually queue at least one run](/cloud-docs/run/ui#manually-starting-runs).

After you have manually queued a run, Terraform Cloud will automatically queue a plan for the workspace when new commits appear in the selected branch of the linked repository or someone opens a pull request on that branch. [Learn more about VCS webhooks](/cloud-docs/vcs/#webhooks).
