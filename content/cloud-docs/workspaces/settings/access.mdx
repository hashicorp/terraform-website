# Managing Access to Workspaces

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team** upgrade package. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

Terraform Cloud workspaces can only be accessed by users with the correct permissions. You can manage permissions for a workspace on a per-team basis.

Teams with [admin access](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) on a workspace can manage permissions for other teams on that workspace. Since newly created workspaces don't have any team permissions configured, the initial setup of a workspace's permissions requires the owners team or a team with permission to manage workspaces.

## Background

Terraform Cloud manages users' permissions to workspaces with teams.

- [Workspace-level permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions) can be granted to an individual team on a particular workspace. These permissions can be managed on the workspace by anyone with admin access to the workspace.
- In addition, some [organization-level permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) can be granted to a team which apply to every workspace in the organization. For example, the
  [manage workspaces](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-workspaces) grants the workspace-level admin permission to every workspace in the organization. Organization-level permissions can only be managed by organization owners.

## Managing Workspace Access Permissions

When a workspace is created, only [the owners team](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#the-owners-team) and teams with the "manage workspaces" permission can access it, with full admin permissions. These teams' access can't be removed from a workspace.

To manage other teams' access, select "Team Access" from a workspace's "Settings" menu.

This screen displays all teams granted workspace-level permissions to the workspace. To add a team, select "Add team and
permissions".

A list of teams which can be added to the workspace is shown. Select a team to continue and select the team's
permissions:

Four [fixed permissions sets](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#fixed-permission-sets) (read, plan, write, and admin) are available for basic usage.

To enable finer-grained selection of non-admin permissions, select "Customize permissions for this team":

On this screen, you may pick and choose individual permissions to grant the team for the workspace.

For more information on permissions, see [the documentation on Workspace
Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions).
