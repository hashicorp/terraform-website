# Example Policies

-> **Note:** Terraform policies are a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** upgrade package. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/policy?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

This page lists some example policies. These examples are not exhaustive, but they demonstrate some of the most common use cases of policies with Terraform Cloud. For more examples, see the [Governance section of the hashicorp/terraform-guides repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides/tree/master/governance/third-generation).

~> **Important:** These examples are a demonstration of the Sentinel policy language and its features. They should not be used verbatim in your Terraform Cloud organization. Make sure you fully understand the intent and behavior of a policy before relying on it in production.

Note that the last policy illustrates how to use Sentinel's [http import](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http) to send an HTTP request to an API endpoint (Terraform Cloud's own API in this case).

-> **Note:** We've also developed a number of first-class foundational policies to work out-of-the-box with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. These policies are based on several [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/). Check out the library of [Terraform Foundational Policies](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library) written by HashiCorp to get up and running with your next [Policy Set](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#policies-and-policy-sets).
