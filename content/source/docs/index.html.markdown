# Terraform Documentation

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

### Get Started

- Learn how Terraform [solves infrastructure challenges](/intro/index.html) and how it [compares to other tools and services](/intro/vs/index.html).
- Install Terraform and explore use cases with the [hands-on tutorials on HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started).


### Manage Infrastructure

- Describe infrastructure on various [providers](/docs/language/providers/index.html) with [Terraform's configuration language](/docs/language/index.html).
- Use the [Terraform CLI](/docs/cli/index.html) to manage configuration, plugins, infrastructure, and state.

### Collaborate

- [Terraform Cloud](/docs/cloud/index.html) helps teams use Terraform together, with version control, state sharing, [governance](/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html), and more.
- [Terraform Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/index.html) is a self-hosted instance of Terraform Cloud.

### Develop and Share

- [Create a provider](/docs/extend/index.html) to allow Terraform to interact with a service.
- Create reusable configurations with [modules](/docs/language/modules/index.html).
- [Publish a provider or module](/docs/registry/index.html) to the Terraform Registry to make it publicly available.
