# Terraform Documentation

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

### Get Started

- Learn how Terraform [solves infrastructure challenges](/intro/index.html) and how it [compares to other tools and services](/intro/vs/index.html).
- [Follow hands-on tutorials on HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started) to install Terraform, create infrastructure, and explore use cases.


### Manage Infrastructure

- Describe infrastructure with [Terraform's configuration language](/docs/language/index.html) on various [providers](/docs/language/providers/index.html).
- Use the [Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI)](/docs/cli/index.html) to manage configuration, plugins, infrastructure, and state.

### Collaborate

- [Terraform Cloud](/docs/cloud/index.html) helps teams use Terraform together, enabling version control, data sharing, and more.
- [Terraform Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/index.html) offers a private instance of Terraform Cloud, with features like access control and governance.

### Develop Plugins

- [Create a provider](/docs/extend/index.html) to allow Terraform to interact with a service.
- [Publish your provider](/docs/registry/index.html) to the Terraform Registry to make it publicly available.
