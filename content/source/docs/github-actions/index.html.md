# Terraform GitHub Actions

This is the documentation for Terraform's GitHub Actions.

[GitHub Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions) allow you to run commands in reaction to GitHub events.
Terraform's GitHub Actions are designed to run on new and updated Pull Requests to help you review
and validate Terraform changes.

If you are new to Terraform's GitHub Actions, begin with the
[Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/index.html).

Here are some example outputs from Terraform's GitHub Actions:
