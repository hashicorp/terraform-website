# Terraform Community

Terraform is a mature project with a growing community. There are active,
dedicated people willing to help you through various mediums.

**Events:** HashiCorp sponsors various community events to bring together
Terraform ecosystem developers. See the
[events](/docs/extend/community/events/index.html) page for more information.

**Stack Exchange:** Terraform questions often get asked and answered on [Server
Fault](https://serverfault.com/) and [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Use the tag "terraform" to help your
question be found by Terraform experts, and please be respectful of the "How to
Ask" guidelines in each community.

**Mailing list:** [Terraform Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/group/terraform-tool)

**Gitter:** [Terraform Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/hashicorp-terraform/Lobby)

**IRC:** Use the [Gitter IRC bridge](https://irc.gitter.im)

**Bug Trackers:** 

- [Terraform Core Issue tracker on
GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues). Please only use this for
reporting bugs. Do not ask for general help here; use a Stack Exchange
community, Gitter chat, or the mailing list for that.

- Terraform Providers distributed by HashiCorp are part of the
[`terraform-providers`](https://github.com/terraform-providers) GitHub
Organization. Each Provider is a separate GitHub project with their own issue
trackers.


**Training:** [Paid HashiCorp training
courses](https://www.hashicorp.com/training.html) are also available in a city
near you. Private training courses are also available.
