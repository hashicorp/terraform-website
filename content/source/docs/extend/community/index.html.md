# Terraform Community

Terraform is a mature project with a growing community. There are active,
dedicated people willing to help you through various mediums.

**Events:** HashiCorp sponsors various community events to bring together
Terraform ecosystem developers. See the
[events](/docs/extend/community/events/index.html) page for more information.

**Stack Exchange:** Terraform questions often get asked and answered on [Server
Fault](https://serverfault.com/) and [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Use the tag "terraform" to help your
question be found by Terraform experts, and please be respectful of the "How to
Ask" guidelines in each community.

**HashiCorp forum:**

- The [Terraform section](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
of the community portal contains questions, use cases, and useful patterns.

- For SDK related questions please visit the
[Terraform Providers section](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers)
of the community portal.

**Bug Trackers:** 

- [Terraform Core Issue tracker on
GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues). Please only use this for
reporting bugs. Do not ask for general help here; use a Stack Exchange
community or the HashiCorp forum for that.

- Terraform Providers distributed by HashiCorp are part of the
[`terraform-providers`](https://github.com/terraform-providers) GitHub
Organization. Each Provider is a separate GitHub project with their own issue
trackers.


**Training:** [Paid HashiCorp training
courses](https://www.hashicorp.com/training.html) are also available in a city
near you. Private training courses are also available.
