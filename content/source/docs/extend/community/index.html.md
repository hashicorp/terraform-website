# Plugin SDK Community

Terraform has an active and growing community of plugin developers
willing to help you through various mediums.

-> Mediums for **users of Terraform** are listed under the main [Community page](/community.html)

- The [Terraform Plugin SDK section](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers/tf-plugin-sdk)
of the community portal contains questions, use cases, and useful patterns.

- [Terraform Plugin SDK Issue tracker on
GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues). Please only use this for
reporting bugs. Do not ask for general help here; use the HashiCorp forum for that.
