# Terraform Plugin Types	

Terraform is logically split into two main parts: Terraform Core and Terraform
Plugins. Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service, such as
the [AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) 
or the [cloud-init provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs).
Terraform Plugins are written in Go and are executable binaries executed as a separate 
process and communicate with the main Terraform binary over an RPC interface.
The network communication and RPC is handled automatically by higher-level Terraform
libraries, so developers need only worry about the implementation of their specific
Plugin behavior. 

The Terraform Plugin SDK currently supports one type of plugin: providers.

## Providers

Providers are the most common type of Plugin, which expose the features that a
specific service offers via its [application programming
interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
(API). Providers define **Resources** and are responsible for managing their
life cycles. Examples of providers are the [Amazon Web Service
Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) or the [Google Cloud
Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest). Example resources are
`aws_instance` and `google_compute_instance`. 

Terraform Providers contain all the code needed to authenticate and connect to a
service on behalf of the user. Each Resource implements `CREATE`, `READ`,
`UPDATE`, and `DELETE` (CRUD) methods to manage itself, while Terraform Core
manages a [Resource Graph](/docs/internals/graph.html) of all the resources
declared in the configuration as well as their current state. Resources remain
ignorant of the current state, only responding to method calls from Terraform
Core and performing the matching CRUD action. 

Terraform determines the Providers needed by reading and interpolating
configuration files. Terraform will dynamically discover and fetch the needed
providers from [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com), or from
specific [locations on disk](/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery).
At time of writing, the source code for all Providers distributed by HashiCorp
for automatic discovery are hosted on in the
[`terraform-providers` GitHub
Organization](https://github.com/terraform-providers).

section to learn more about our existing Providers.
