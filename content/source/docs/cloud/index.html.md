# Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise

This is the documentation for Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise.

Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are different distributions of the same application; this documentation applies to both of them except when specifically stated otherwise.

For expediency, this documentation refers to the application as Terraform Cloud.

## About Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise

[Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/) is an application that helps teams use Terraform together. It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, and includes easy access to shared state and secret data, access controls for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy controls for governing the contents of Terraform configurations, and more.

Terraform Cloud is available as a hosted service at [https://app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io). We offer free accounts for small teams, and paid plans with additional feature sets for medium-sized businesses.

Large enterprises can purchase [Terraform Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/index.html), our self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud. It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

### Note About Product Names

Before mid-2019, all distributions of Terraform Cloud used to be called Terraform Enterprise; the self-hosted distribution was called Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE). These previous names sometimes still appear in supporting tools (like [the `tfe` Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest), which is also intended for use with Terraform Cloud).

## Who is This Documentation For?

The Terraform Cloud documentation is for everyone who uses the Terraform Cloud application to provision and manage infrastructure. This includes Terraform Enterprise users, since Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud are the same application.

The [Terraform Enterprise deployment and operation documentation](/docs/enterprise/index.html) is for admins and operators who install and maintain their organization's Terraform Enterprise instance.
