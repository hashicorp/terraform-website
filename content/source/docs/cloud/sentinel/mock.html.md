# Mocking Terraform Sentinel Data

-> **Note:** Sentinel policies are a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** upgrade package. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

We recommend that you test your Sentinel policies extensively before deploying
them within Terraform Cloud. An important part of this process is mocking
the data that you wish your policies to operate on.

Due to the highly variable structure of data that can be produced by an
individual Terraform configuration, Terraform Cloud provides the ability to
generate mock data from existing configurations. This can be used to create
sample data for a new policy, or data to reproduce issues in an existing one.

Testing policies is done using the [Sentinel
CLI](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands). More general information on
testing Sentinel policies can be found in the [Testing
section](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/writing/testing) of the [Sentinel
runtime documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel).

~> **Be careful!** Mock data generated by Terraform Cloud directly exposes any
and all data within the configuration, plan, and state. Terraform attempts to
scrub sensitive data from these mocks, but we do not guarantee 100% accuracy.
Treat this data with care, and avoid generating mocks with live sensitive data
when possible. Access to this information requires [permission to download
Sentinel mocks](/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/permissions.html) for the
workspace where the data was generated.

## Generating Mock Data Using the UI

Mock data can be generated using the UI by expanding the plan status section of
the run page, and clicking on the **Download Sentinel mocks** button.

![sentinel mock generate ui](/assets/images/guides/sentinel/download-mocks.png)

For more information on creating a run, see the
[Terraform Runs and Remote Operations](../run/index.html) section of the docs.

If the button is not visible, then the plan is ineligible for mock generation or
the user doesn't have the necessary permissions. See [Mock Data
Availability](#mock-data-availability) for more details.

## Generating Mock Data Using the API

Mock data can also be created with the [Plan Export
API](/docs/cloud/api/plan-exports.html).

Multiple steps are required for mock generation. The export process is
asynchronous, so you must monitor the request to know when the data is generated
and available for download.

1. Get the plan ID for the run that you want to generate the mock for by
   [getting the run details](/docs/cloud/api/run.html#get-run-details).
   Look for the `id` of the `plan` object within the `relationships` section of
   the return data.
1. [Request a plan
  export](/docs/cloud/api/plan-exports.html#create-a-plan-export) using the
  discovered plan ID. Supply the Sentinel export type `sentinel-mock-bundle-v0`.
1. Monitor the export request by [viewing the plan
  export](/docs/cloud/api/plan-exports.html#show-a-plan-export). When the
  status is `finished`, the data is ready for download.
1. Finally, [download the export
   data](/docs/cloud/api/plan-exports.html#download-exported-plan-data).
   You have up to an hour from the completion of the export request - after
   that, the mock data expires and must be re-generated.

## Using Mock Data

-> **Note:** The v2 mock files are only available on Terraform 0.12 and higher.

Mock data is supplied as a bundled tarball, containing the following files:

```
mock-tfconfig.sentinel    # tfconfig mock data
mock-tfconfig-v2.sentinel # tfconfig/v2 mock data
mock-tfplan.sentinel      # tfplan mock data
mock-tfplan-v2.sentinel   # tfplan/v2 mock data
mock-tfstate.sentinel     # tfstate mock data
mock-tfstate-v2.sentinel  # tfstate/v2 mock data
mock-tfrun.sentinel       # tfrun mock data
sentinel.hcl              # sample configruation file
```

The sample `sentinel.hcl` file contains mappings to the mocks so that you
can get started testing with `sentinel apply` right away. For `sentinel test`,
however, we recommend a more detailed layout.

We recommend placing the files for `sentinel test` in a subdirectory
of the repository holding your policies, so they don't interfere with the
command's automatic policy detection. While the test data is Sentinel code, it's
not a policy and will produce errors if evaluated like one.

```
.
├── foo.sentinel
├── sentinel.hcl
├── test
│   └── foo
│       ├── fail.hcl
│       └── pass.hcl
└── testdata
    ├── mock-tfconfig.sentinel
    ├── mock-tfconfig-v2.sentinel
    ├── mock-tfplan.sentinel
    ├── mock-tfplan-v2.sentinel
    ├── mock-tfstate.sentinel
    ├── mock-tfstate-v2.sentinel
    └── mock-tfrun.sentinel
```

Each configuration that needs access to the mock should reference the mock data
files within the `mock` block in the Sentinel configuration file.

For `sentinel apply`, this path is relative to the working directory. Assuming
you always run this command from the repository root, the `sentinel.hcl`
configuration file would look like:

```hcl
mock "tfconfig" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfconfig.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfconfig/v1" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfconfig.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfconfig/v2" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfconfig-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfplan.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan/v1" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfplan.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan/v2" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfplan-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfstate.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate/v1" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfstate.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate/v2" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfstate-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfrun" {
  module {
    source = "testdata/mock-tfrun.sentinel"
  }
}
```

For `sentinel test`, the paths are relative to the specific test configuration
file. For example, the contents of `pass.json`, asserting that the result of the
`main` rule was `true`, would be:

```
mock "tfconfig" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfconfig.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfconfig/v1" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfconfig.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfconfig/v2" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfconfig-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfplan.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan/v1" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfplan.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfplan/v2" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfplan-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfstate.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate/v1" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfstate.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfstate/v2" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfstate-v2.sentinel"
  }
}

mock "tfrun" {
  module {
    source = "../../testdata/mock-tfrun.sentinel"
  }
}

test {
  rules = {
    main = true
  }
}
```

## Mock Data Availability

The following factors can prevent you from generating mock data:

* You do not have permission to download Sentinel mocks for the workspace.
  ([More about permissions.](/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/permissions.html))
  Permission is required to protect the possibly sensitive data which can be
  produced via mock generation.
* The run has not progressed past the planning stage, or did not create a plan
  successfully.
* The run has been in a terminal state, such as applied or discarded, longer
  than seven days. At this point, the data necessary to generate the mocks is no
  longer available.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

If a plan cannot have its mock data exported due to any of these reasons, the
**Download Sentinel mocks** button within the plan status section of the UI will
not be visible.

-> **Note:** Only the plan needs to be successful for a run to be eligible for
mock generation - if the apply or the policy checks fail, the data can still be
generated, as long as it's within the 7 day expiration period.
