-> **Note:** Sentinel policies are a paid feature, available as part of the **Team & Governance** upgrade package. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing/).

-> **Note:** This is documentation for the next version of the `tfconfig`
Sentinel import, designed specifically for Terraform 0.12. This import requires
Terraform 0.12 or higher, and must currently be loaded by path, using an alias,
example: `import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig`.

# Import: tfconfig/v2

The `tfconfig/v2` import provides access to a Terraform configuration.

The Terraform configuration is the set of `*.tf` files that are used to
describe the desired infrastructure state. Policies using the `tfconfig`
import can access all aspects of the configuration: providers, resources,
data sources, modules, and variables.

Some use cases for `tfconfig` include:

* **Organizational naming conventions**: requiring that configuration elements
  are named in a way that conforms to some organization-wide standard.
* **Required inputs and outputs**: organizations may require a particular set
  of input variable names across all workspaces or may require a particular
  set of outputs for asset management purposes.
* **Enforcing particular modules**: organizations may provide a number of
  "building block" modules and require that each workspace be built only from
  combinations of these modules.
* **Enforcing particular providers or resources**: an organization may wish to
  require or prevent the use of providers and/or resources so that configuration
  authors cannot use alternative approaches to work around policy
  restrictions.

The data in the `tfconfig/v2` import is sourced from the JSON configuration file
that is generated by the [`terraform show
-json`](/docs/commands/show.html#json-output) command. For more information on
the file format, see the [JSON Output Format](/docs/internals/json-format.html)
page.

## Import Overview

The `tfconfig/v2` import is structured as a series of _collections_, keyed as a
specific format, such as resource address, module address, or a
specifically-formatted provider key.

        ├── for_each (expression representation) (not implemented)
        └── version_constraint (string)
```

The collections are:

* [`providers`](#the-providers-collection) - The configuration for all provider
  instances across all modules in the configuration.
* [`resources`](#the-resources-collection) - The configuration of all resources
  across all modules in the configuration.
* [`variables`](#the-variables-collection) - The configuration of all variable
  definitions across all modules in the configuration.
* [`outputs`](#the-outputs-collection) - The configuration of all output
  definitions across all modules in the configuration.
* [`module_calls`](#the-variables-collection) - The configuration of all module
  calls (individual [`module`](/docs/configuration/modules.html) blocks) across
  all modules in the configuration.

These collections are specifically designed to be used with the
[`filter`](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/collection-operations/#filter-expression)
quantifier expression in Sentinel, so that one can collect a list of resources
to perform policy checks on without having to write complex module or
configuration traversal. As an example, the following code will return all
`aws_instance` resource types within the configuration, regardless of what
module they are in:

```
all_aws_instances = filter tfconfig.resources as _, r {
	r.mode is "managed" and
		r.type is "aws_instance"
}
```

You can add specific attributes to the filter to narrow the search, such as the
module address. The following code would return resources in a module named
`foo` only:

```
all_aws_instances = filter tfconfig.resources as _, r {
	r.module_address is "module.foo" and
		r.mode is "managed" and
		r.type is "aws_instance"
}
```

### Address Differences Between `tfconfig`, `tfplan`, and `tfstate`

This import deals with configuration before it is expanded into a
resource graph by Terraform. As such, it is not possible to compute an index as
the import is building its collections and computing addresses for resources and
modules.

As such, addresses found here may not always match the expanded addresses found
in the [`tfplan/v2`](./tfplan-v2.html) and [`tfstate/v2`](./tfstate-v2.html)
imports, specifically when
[`count`](/docs/configuration/resources.html#count-multiple-resource-instances-by-count)
and
[`for_each`](/docs/configuration/resources.html#for_each-multiple-resource-instances-defined-by-a-map-or-set-of-strings),
are used.

As an example, consider a resource named `null_resource.foo` with a count of `2`
located in a module named `bar`. While there will possibly be entries in the
other imports for `module.bar.null_resource.foo[0]` and
`module.bar.null_resource.foo[1]`, in `tfconfig/v2`, there will only be a
`module.bar.null_resource.foo`. As mentioned in the start of this section, this
is because configuration actually _defines_ this scaling, whereas _expansion_
actually happens when the resource graph is built, which happens as a natural
part of the refresh and planning process.

The `strip_index` helper function, found in this import, can assist in
removing the indexes from addresses found in the `tfplan/v2` and `tfstate/v2`
imports so that data from those imports can be used to reference data in this
one.

## The `strip_index` Function

The `strip_index` helper function can be used to remove indexes from addresses
found in [`tfplan/v2`](./tfplan-v2.html) and [`tfstate/v2`](./tfstate-v2.html),
by removing the indexes from each resource.

This can be used to help facilitate cross-import lookups for data between plan,
state, and config.

```
import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

main = rule {
	all filter tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
		rc.mode is "managed" and
			rc.type is "aws_instance"
	} as _, rc {
		tfconfig.resources[tfconfig.strip_index(rc.address)].config.ami.constant_value is "ami-abcdefgh012345"
	}
}
```

## Expression Representations

Most collections in this import will have one of two kinds of _expression
representations_. This is a verbose format for expressing a (parsed)
configuration value independent of the configuration source code, which is not
100% available to a policy check in Terraform Cloud.

```
(expression representation)
├── constant_value (value)
└── references (list of strings)
```

There are two major parts to an expression representation:

* Any _strictly constant value_ is expressed as an expression with a
  `constant_value` field.
* Any expression that requires some degree of evaluation to generate the final
  value - even if that value is known at plan time - is not expressed in
  configuration. Instead, any particular references that are made are added to
  the `references` field. More details on this field can be found in the
  [expression
  representation](/docs/internals/json-format.html#expression-representation)
  section of the JSON output format documentation.

For example, to determine if an output is based on a particular
resource value, one could do:

```
import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig

main = rule {
	tfconfig.outputs["instance_id"].value.references is ["aws_instance.foo"]
}
```

-> **NOTE:** The expression representation currently does not account for
complex interpolations or other expressions that combine constants with other
expression data. An example would be something like `"foo${var.bar}"` or `"foo"
+ var.bar`.  In this situation, the partially constant data would be lost. We
will be working to resolve this within future versions of the `tfconfig/v2`
import.

### Block Expression Representation

Expanding on the above, a multi-value expression representation (such as the
kind found in a [`resources`](#the-resources-collection) collection element) is
similar, but the root value is a keyed map of expression representations. This
is repeated until a "scalar" expression value is encountered, ie: a field that
is not a block in the resource's schema.

```
(block expression representation)
└── (attribute key)
    ├── (child block expression representation)
    │   └── (...)
    ├── constant_value (value)
    └── references (list of strings)
```

As an example, one can validate expressions in an
[`aws_instance`](/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html) resource using the
following:

```
import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig

main = rule {
	tfconfig.resources["aws_instance.foo"].config.ami.constant_value is "ami-abcdefgh012345"
}
```

Note that _nested blocks_, sometimes known as _sub-resources_, will be nested in
configuration as as list of blocks (reflecting their ultimate nature as a list
of objects). An example would be the `aws_instance` resource's
[`ebs_block_device`](/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html#block-devices) block:

```
import "tfconfig/v2" as tfconfig

main = rule {
	tfconfig.resources["aws_instance.foo"].config.ebs_block_device[0].volume_size < 10
}
```

## The `providers` Collection

The `providers` collection is a collection representing the configurations of
all provider instances across all modules in the configuration.

This collection is indexed by an opaque key. This is currently
`module_address:provider.alias`, the same value as found in the
`provider_config_key` field. `module_address` and the colon delimiter are
omitted for the root module.

The `provider_config_key` field is also found in the `resources` collection and
can be used to locate a provider that belongs to a configured resource.

The fields in this collection are as follows:

* `provider_config_key` - The opaque configuration key, used as the index key.
* `name` - The name of the provider, ie: `aws`.
* `alias` - The alias of the provider, ie: `east`. Empty for a default provider.
* `module_address` - The address of the module this provider appears in.
* `config` - A [block expression
  representation](#block-expression-representation) with provider configuration
  values.
* `version_constraint` - The defined version constraint for this provider.

## The `resources` Collection

The `resources` collection is a collection representing all of the resources
found in all modules in the configuration.

This collection is indexed by the resource address.

The fields in this collection are as follows:

* `address` - The resource address. This is the index of the collection.
* `module_address` - The module address that this resource was found in.
* `mode` - The resource mode, either `managed` (resources) or `data` (data
  sources).
* `type` - The type of resource, ie: `null_resource` in `null_resource.foo`.
* `name` - The name of the resource, ie: `foo` in `null_resource.foo`.
* `provider_config_key` - The opaque configuration key that serves as the index
  of the [`providers`](#the-providers-collection) collection.
* `provisioners` - The ordered list of provisioners for this resource. The
  syntax of the provisioners matches those found in the
  [`provisioners`](#the-provisioners-collection) collection, but is a list
  indexed by the order the provisioners show up in the resource.
* `config` - The [block expression
  representation](#block-expression-representation) of the configuration values
  found in the resource.
* `count` - The [expression data](#expression-representations) for the `count`
  value in the resource.
* `for_each` - The [expression data](#expression-representations) for the
  `for_each` value in the resource.
* `depends_on` - The contents of the `depends_on` config directive, which
  declares explicit dependencies for this resource.

## The `provisioners` Collection

The `provisioners` collection is a collection of all of the provisioners found
across all resources in the configuration.

While normally bound to a resource in an ordered fashion, this collection allows
for the filtering of provisioners within a single expression.

This collection is indexed with a key following the format
`resource_address:index`, with each field matching their respective field in the
particular element below:

* `resource_address`: The address of the resource that the provisioner was found
  in. This can be found in the [`resources`](#the-resources-collection)
  collection.
* `type`: The provisioner type, ie: `local_exec`.
* `index`: The provisioner index as it shows up in the resource provisioner
  order.
* `config`: The [block expression
  representation](#block-expression-representation) of the configuration values
  in the provisioner.

## The `variables` Collection

The `variables` collection is a collection of all variables across all modules
in the configuration.

Note that this tracks variable definitions, not values. See the [`tfplan/v2`
`variables` collection](./tfplan-v2.html#the-variables-collection) for variable
values set within a plan.

This collection is indexed by the key format `module_address:name`, with each
field matching their respective name below. `module_address` and the colon
delimiter are omitted for the root module.

* `module_address` - The address of the module the variable was found in.
* `name` - The name of the variable.
* `default` - The defined default value of the variable.
* `description` - The description of the variable.

## The `outputs` Collection

The `outputs` collection is a collection of all outputs across all modules in
the configuration.

Note that this tracks variable definitions, not values. See the [`tfstate/v2`
`outputs` collection](./tfstate-v2.html#the-outputs-collection) for the final
values of outputs set within a state. The [`tfplan/v2` `output_changes`
collection](./tfplan-v2.html#the-output_changes-collection) also contains a more
complex collection of planned output changes.

This collection is indexed by the key format `module_address:name`, with each
field matching their respective name below. `module_address` and the colon
delimiter are omitted for the root module.

* `module_address` - The address of the module the output was found in.
* `name` - The name of the output.
* `sensitive` - Indicates whether or not the output was marked as
  [`sensitive`](/docs/configuration/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output).
* `value` - An [expression representation](#expression-representations) for the output.
* `description` - The description of the output.
* `depends_on`: A list of resource names that the output depends on. These are
  the hard-defined output dependencies as defined in the
  [`depends_on`](/docs/configuration/outputs.html#depends_on-explicit-output-dependencies)
  field in an output declaration, not the dependencies that get derived from
  natural evaluation of the output expression (these can be found in the
  `references` field of the expression representation).

## The `module_calls` Collection

The `module_calls` collection is a collection of all module declarations at all
levels within the configuration.

Note that this is the
[`module`](/docs/configuration/modules.html#calling-a-child-module) stanza in
any particular configuration, and not the module itself. Hence, a declaration
for `module.foo` would actually be declared in the root module, which would be
represented by a blank field in `module_address`.

This collection is indexed by the key format `module_address:name`, with each
field matching their respective name below. `module_address` and the colon
delimiter are omitted for the root module.

* `module_address` - The address of the module the declaration was found in.
* `name` - The name of the module.
* `source` - The contents of the `source` field.
* `config` - A [block expression
  representation](#block-expression-representation) for all parameter values
  sent to the module.
* `count` - An [expression representation](#expression-representations) for the
  `count` field (not currently in use).
* `for_each` - An [expression representation](#expression-representations) for
  the `for_each` field (not currently in use).
* `version_constraint` - The string value found in the `version` field of the
  module declaration.

-> **NOTE:** As `count` and `for_each` are currently not implemented in modules,
the `count` and `for_each` fields will always be blank.
