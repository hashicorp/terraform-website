# Run Tasks Integration

* When creating and event hook, we send a test POST to the supplied URL, which must respond with a 200 in order for the event hook to be created.

* When a run reaches the pre apply phase and an event hook is triggered, the supplied URL will receive the following payload:

```json

```

* You should respond to this request with a 200, or we will retry?

* Table of above attributes and descriptions goes here.

* We expect you to callback to the supplied `task_result_callback_url` using the `access_token` as an Authorization Header (link-to our authorization docs) with a jsonapi (link to jsonapi) payload of the form:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "task-results",
      "attributes": {
        "status": "passed",
        "message": "Hello task"
      }
  }
}
```

* We expect this callback within X minutes, or SOMETHING happens.
