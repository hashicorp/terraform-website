# Variables

Terraform Cloud workspaces can set values for two kinds of variables:

- [Terraform input variables][variables], which define the parameters of a Terraform configuration.
- Shell environment variables, which many providers can use for credentials and other data. You can also set [environment variables that affect Terraform's behavior](/docs/cli/config/environment-variables.html), like `TF_LOG`.

You can edit a workspace's variables via the UI or the API. All runs in a workspace use its variables.

Viewing variables requires permission to read variables for the workspace, and setting values requires permission to read and write variables. ([More about permissions.](/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/permissions.html))

-> **API:** See the [Variables API](../api/variables.html). <br/>
**Terraform:** See the `tfe` provider's [`tfe_variable`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/variable) resource.

## Loading Variables from Files

If a workspace is configured to use Terraform 0.10.0 or later, you can commit any number of [`*.auto.tfvars` files](/docs/language/values/variables.html#variable-files) to provide default variable values. Terraform will automatically load variables from those files.

If any automatically loaded variables have the same names as variables specified in the Terraform Cloud workspace, the workspace's values will override the automatic values.

You can also use the optional [Terraform Cloud Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/variable) to update a workspace's variables. This has the same effect as managing workspace variables manually or via the API, but can be more convenient for large numbers of complex variables.

## Variable Limits

The following limits apply to variables:

Component   |  Limit
------------|---------------------------
description |  512 characters
key         |  128 characters
value       |  256 kilobytes

## Managing Variables in the UI

To view and manage a workspace's variables, navigate to that workspace and click the "Variables" navigation link at the top.

The variables page has separate lists of Terraform variables and environment variables:

To edit a variable, click one of its text fields or its pencil (edit) icon to reveal the editing controls. Make any desired changes to the variable's name, value, description, and settings, then click the "Save Variable" button.

To add a variable, click the "+ Add Variable" button, enter a name, value, optional description, and save.

To delete a variable, click its "ðŸ—‘" (trash can) icon, then confirm your decision in the dialog box that appears.

You can edit one variable at a time, and must save or cancel your current edits before editing other variables in the list.

### Multi-line Values

The text fields for variable values can handle multi-line text (typed or pasted) without any special effort.

### HCL Values

Variable values are strings by default. To enter list or map values, click the variable's "HCL" checkbox (visible when editing) and enter the value with the same HCL syntax you would use when writing Terraform code. For example:

```hcl
{
    us-east-1 = "image-1234"
    us-west-2 = "image-4567"
}
```

HCL can be used for Terraform variables, but not for environment variables. The HCL code you enter for values is interpreted by the same Terraform version that performs runs in the workspace. (See [How Terraform Cloud Uses Variables](#how-terraform-cloud-uses-variables) below.)

### Sensitive Values

Terraform often needs cloud provider credentials and other sensitive information that shouldn't be widely available within your organization.

To protect these secrets, you can mark any Terraform or environment variable as sensitive data by clicking its "Sensitive" checkbox (visible when editing).

Marking a variable as sensitive prevents anybody (including you) from viewing its value in the variables section of the workspace in Terraform Cloud's UI or with its Variables API endpoint.

Users with permission to read and write variables can set new values for sensitive variables.  No other attribute of a sensitive variable can be modified. To update other attributes, delete the variable and create a new variable to replace it.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

~> **Important:** Terraform runs will receive the full text of sensitive variables, and might print the value in logs and state files if the configuration pipes the value through to an output or a resource parameter. Additionally, Sentinel mocks downloaded from runs will contain the sensitive values of Terraform (but not environment) variables. Take care when writing your configurations to avoid unnecessary credential disclosure. Whenever possible, use environment variables since these cannot end up in state files or in Sentinel mocks. (Environment variables can end up in log files if TF_LOG is set to TRACE.)

### Looking Up Variable Names

Terraform Cloud can't automatically discover variable names from a workspace's Terraform code. You must discover the necessary variable names by reading code or documentation, then enter them manually.

If a required input variable is missing, Terraform plans in the workspace will fail and print an explanation in the log.

### Descriptions

Variable descriptions help distinguish between similarly named variables. These optional fields are only shown on this "Variables" page and are completely independent from any variable descriptions declared in Terraform CLI.

## How Terraform Cloud Uses Variables

### Terraform Variables

Terraform Cloud passes variables to Terraform by writing a `terraform.tfvars` file and passing the `-var-file=terraform.tfvars` option to the Terraform command.

Do not commit a file named `terraform.tfvars` to version control, since Terraform Cloud will overwrite it. (Note that you shouldn't check in `terraform.tfvars` even when running Terraform solely on the command line.)

### Environment Variables

Terraform Cloud performs Terraform runs on disposable Linux worker VMs using a POSIX-compatible shell. Before running Terraform, Terraform Cloud populates the shell with environment variables using the `export` command.

### Special Environment Variables

Terraform Cloud uses some special environment variables to control dangerous or rarely used run behaviors.

- `TFE_PARALLELISM` â€”Â If present, Terraform Cloud uses this to set `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`'s `-parallelism=<N>` flag ([more info](/docs/internals/graph.html#walking-the-graph)). Valid values are between 1 and 256, inclusive; the default is `10`. This is rarely necessary, but can fix problems with infrastructure providers that error on concurrent operations or use non-standard rate limiting. We recommend talking to HashiCorp support before using this.

-> **Note:** `TFE_PARALLELISM` is not supported by Terraform Cloud Agents, but Terraform allows you to specify flags as environment variables directly via [TF_CLI_ARGS](/docs/cli/config/environment-variables.html#tf-cli-args). Use `TF_CLI_ARGS="parallelism=<N>"` instead.

### Secure Storage of Variables

Terraform Cloud encrypts all variable values securely using [Vault's transit backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html) prior to saving them. This ensures that no out-of-band party can read these values without proper authorization.

Descriptions are not encrypted. Please be careful with the information you save in a variable description.
