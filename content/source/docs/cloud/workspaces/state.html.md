# Terraform State in Terraform Cloud

Each Terraform Cloud workspace has its own separate state data, used for runs within that workspace.

-> **API:** See the [State Versions API](../api/state-versions.html).

## State Usage in Terraform Runs

In [remote runs](../run/index.html), Terraform Cloud automatically configures Terraform to use the workspace's state; the Terraform configuration does not need an explicit backend configuration. (If a backend configuration is present, it will be overridden.)

In local runs (available for workspaces whose execution mode setting is set to "local"), you can use a workspace's state by configuring [the `remote` backend](/docs/backends/types/remote.html) and authenticating with a user token that has permission to read and write state versions for the relevant workspace. When using a Terraform configuration that references outputs from another workspace, the authentication token must also have permission to read state outputs for that workspace. ([More about permissions.](/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/permissions.html))

## State Versions

In addition to the current state, Terraform Cloud retains historical state versions, which can be used to analyze infrastructure changes over time.

You can view a workspace's state versions from its "States" tab. Each state in the list indicates which run and which VCS commit (if applicable) it was associated with. Click a state in the list for more details, including a diff against the previous state and a link to the raw state file.

## State Manipulation

Certain tasks (including importing resources, tainting resources, moving or renaming existing resources to match a changed configuration, and more) require modifying Terraform state outside the context of a run.

Manual state manipulation in Terraform Cloud workspaces requires the use of Terraform CLI, using the same commands as would be used in a local workflow (`terraform import`, `terraform taint`, etc.). To manipulate state, you must configure [the `remote` backend](/docs/backends/types/remote.html) and authenticate with a user token that has permission to read and write state versions for the relevant workspace. ([More about permissions.](/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/permissions.html))

## Cross-Workspace State Access

In your Terraform configurations, you can use a [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html) to access [outputs](/docs/configuration/outputs.html) from your other workspaces.

~> **Important:** A given workspace can only access state data from within the same organization. If you plan to use multiple Terraform Cloud organizations, make sure to keep related groups of workspaces together in the same organization.

To configure a data source that references a Terraform Cloud workspace, set the data source's `backend` argument to `remote` and specify the organization and workspace in the `config` argument.

``` hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
  backend = "remote"
  config = {
    organization = "example_corp"
    workspaces = {
      name = "vpc-prod"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "redis_server" {
  # Terraform 0.12 syntax: use the "outputs.<OUTPUT NAME>" attribute
  subnet_id = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet_id

  # Terraform 0.11 syntax: use the "<OUTPUT NAME>" attribute
  subnet_id = "${data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.subnet_id}"
}
```
