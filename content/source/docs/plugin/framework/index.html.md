# Next-Generation Plugin Framework

The next-generation plugin framework is a new way to develop Terraform plugins, providing improvements and new features from [Teraform Plugin SDKv2](/docs/extend/index.html).

HashiCorp is currently developing providers against this new framework, and we believe it is ready for third-party developers to use. However, it is still early in its development cycle, so its interfaces are subject to change and it may not yet support all of your desired features. It can also only build providers that require **Terraform v1.0.3 or later**.

[Which SDK Should I
Use?](/docs/plugin/which-sdk.html) can help you decide whether the next-generation framework is right for your provider.
