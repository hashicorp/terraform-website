# Configuring Bitbucket Cloud Access

These instructions are for using Bitbucket Cloud for Terraform Enterprise (TFE)'s VCS features. Bitbucket Cloud is the cloud-hosted version of Bitbucket; [self-hosted Bitbucket Server instances have separate instructions,](./bitbucket-server.html) as do the [other supported VCS providers.](./index.html)

Connecting TFE to your VCS involves five steps:

On your VCS | On TFE
--|--
Register your TFE organization as a new app. Get ID and key. | &nbsp;
&nbsp; | Tell TFE how to reach VCS, and provide ID and key. Get callback URL.
Provide callback URL. | &nbsp;
&nbsp; | Request VCS access.
Approve access request. | &nbsp;

The rest of this page explains the Bitbucket Cloud-specific versions of these steps.

-> **Note:** Alternately, you can skip the OAuth configuration process and authenticate with an app password. This requires using TFE's API. For details, see [the OAuth Clients API page](../api/oauth-clients.html).

## Step 1: On Bitbucket Cloud, Create a New OAuth Consumer

1. Open [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) in your browser and log in as whichever account you want TFE to act as. For most organizations this should be a dedicated service user, but a personal account will also work.

    ~> **Important:** The account you use for connecting TFE **must have admin access** to any shared repositories of Terraform configurations, since creating webhooks requires admin permissions.

2. Navigate to Bitbucket's "Add OAuth Consumer" page.

    This page is located at `https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<YOUR USERNAME>/oauth-consumers/new`. You can also reach it through Bitbucket's's menus:
    - In the lower left corner, click your profile picture and choose "Bitbucket settings."
    - In the settings navigation, click "OAuth," which is in the "Access Management" section.
    - On the OAuth settings page, click the "Add consumer" button.

3. This page has a form with four text fields and many checkboxes.

    ![Bitbucket Cloud screenshot: New OAuth consumer text fields and permissions checkboxes](./images/bitbucket-cloud-add-consumer.png)

    Fill out the text fields as follows:

    Field            | Value
    -----------------|--------------------------------------------------
    Name             | Terraform Enterprise (`<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME>`)
    Description      | Any description of your choice.
    Callback URL     | `https://example.com/replace-this-later` (or any placeholder; the correct URI doesn't exist until the next step.)
    URL              | `https://app.terraform.io` (or the URL of your private TFE install)

    Ensure that the "This is a private consumer" option is checked. Then, activate the following permissions checkboxes:

    Permission type | Permission level
    ----------------|-----------------
    Account         | Write
    Repositories    | Admin
    Pull requests   | Write
    Webhooks        | Read and write

4. Click the "Save" button, which returns you to the OAuth settings page.

5. Find your new OAuth consumer under the "OAuth Consumers" heading, and click its name to reveal its details.

    Leave this page open in a browser tab. In the next step, you will copy and paste the unique **Key** and **Secret.**

## Step 2: On TFE, Add a VCS Provider

1. Open TFE in your browser and navigate to the "VCS Provider" settings for your organization. Click the "Add VCS Provider" button.

    If you just created your organization, you might already be on this page. Otherwise:

    1. Click the upper-left organization menu, making sure it currently shows your organization.
    1. Click the "Settings" link at the top of the page (or within the &#9776; menu)
    1. On the next page, click "VCS Provider" in the left sidebar.
    1. Click the "Add VCS Provider" button.

2. The next page has a drop-down and four text fields. Select "Bitbucket Cloud" from the drop-down, and enter the **Key** and **Secret** from the previous step. (Ignore the two disabled URL fields, which are used for on-premise VCSs.)

    ![TFE screenshot: add client fields](./images/bitbucket-cloud-tfe-add-client-fields.png)

3. Click "Create VCS Provider." This will take you back to the VCS Provider page, which now includes your new Bitbucket client.

4. Locate the new client's "Callback URL," and copy it to your clipboard; you'll paste it in the next step. Leave this page open in a browser tab.

    ![TFE screenshot: callback url](./images/bitbucket-cloud-tfe-callback-url.png)

## Step 3: On Bitbucket Cloud, Update the Callback URL

1. Go back to your Bitbucket Cloud browser tab. (If you accidentally closed it, you can reach your OAuth settings page through the menus: use the lower left menu > Bitbucket settings > OAuth.)

2. Locate your TFE OAuth consumer. Click the elipsis ("...") button on the far right, and choose "Edit" from the menu.

    ![Bitbucket Cloud screenshot: Revealing the edit link with the elipsis button](./images/bitbucket-cloud-edit-consumer.png)

3. In the "Callback URL" field, paste the callback URL from TFE's OAuth Configuration page, replacing the "example.com" placeholder you entered earlier.

4. Click the "Save" button. A banner saying the update succeeded should appear.

## Step 4: On TFE, Request Access

1. Go back to your TFE browser tab and click the "Connect organization `<NAME>`" button on the VCS Provider page.

    ![TFE screenshot: the connect organization button](./images/tfe-connect-orgname.png)

    This takes you to a page on Bitbucket Cloud, asking whether you want to authorize the app.

    ![Bitbucket Cloud screenshot: the authorization screen](./images/bitbucket-cloud-authorize.png)

2. Click the green "Authorize" button at the bottom of the authorization page. This returns you to TFE's VCS Provider page, where the Bitbucket Cloud client's information has been updated.

## Finished

At this point, Bitbucket Cloud access for TFE is fully configured, and you can create Terraform workspaces based on your organization's shared repositories.
