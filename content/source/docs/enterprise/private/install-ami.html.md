!> **Deprecation warning**: The AMI will no longer be actively developed as of 201808-1 and will be fully decommissioned on November 30, 2018. Please see our [Migration Guide](./migrate.html) for instructions to migrate to the new Private Terraform Enterprise Installer.

# Private Terraform Enterprise Installation (AMI)

## Delivery

The goal of this installation procedure is to set up a Terraform Enterprise
cluster that is available on a DNS name that is accessed via HTTPS. This
standard configuration package uses Terraform to create both the compute and data layer resources, and optionally uses Route53 to configure the DNS automatically.

-> **Note**: This document applies to the standard AMI-based deliverable of Private Terraform Enterprise. If you are using the Installer, please see the [instructions for the Installer](./install-installer.html).

## Preflight

### Dependencies

Before setup begins, a few resources need to be provisioned. We consider these out of scope for the cluster provisioning because they depend on the user's environment.

The following are **required** to complete installation:

* **AWS IAM credentials** capable of creating new IAM roles configuring various services. We strongly suggest you use the `AdministratorAccess` policy for this. The credentials are only used for setup; during runtime only an assumed role is used.
* **AWS VPC** containing at least 2 subnets. These will be used to launch the cluster into. Subnets do not need to be public, but they do need an internet gateway at present. If two private subnets are used they should each be in a seperate Availability Zone (AZ). Also, if a third public subnet is used, and the instance resides in a private subnet, the public subnet must be in the same AZ as the instance.
* **SSH Key Pair** configured with AWS EC2. This will be used to configure support access to the cluster. This SSH key can be optionally removed from the instance once installation is complete.
  * To create a new one, [see Amazon's docs for EC2 key pairs.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
* A **Publicly Trusted TLS certificate** registered with AWS Certificate Manager. This can be one created by ACM for a hostname or the certificate can be imported into it.
  * To create a new ACM-managed cert: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/wizard/>
  * To import an existing cert: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/importwizard/>
  * *NOTE:* Certificates are per region, so be sure to create them in the same region as you'll be deploying Terraform Enterprise into.
  * *NOTE:* The certificate must allow the fully qualified hostname that Terraform Enterprise will be using. This means you need to decide on a final hostname when creating the certificates and use the same value in the configuration.

### Clone the Installer Git Repo

Private Terraform Enterprise installs via Terraform. It is expected you have downloaded the Terraform Open Source binary to the machine where you will be doing the install from. To get started you will also need to clone a repo that contains the necessary modules and variable files.

* Open a terminal on a machine that has full network access to the AWS account where Private Terraform Enterprise will be deployed. Enter the following to clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-modules.git
```
* Once the clone is complete cd into the `terraform-enterprise-modules/aws-standard/` directory.

The following details will be requested during the application bootstrapping process. It's helpful to have them prepared beforehand.

* **SMTP Credentials**: Terraform Enterprise requires SMTP information to send email. SMTP configuration can be skipped if necessary during the installation, but HashiCorp recommends configuring it during the initial bootstrapping process.
  * Hostname and port of SMTP service
  * Type of authentication (plain or login)
  * Username and password
  * Email address to use as the sender for emails originating from Terraform Enterprise
* (Optional) **Twilio Credentials**: Terraform Enterprise can use Twilio for SMS-based 2-factor authentication. If Twilio is not configurated, virtual MFA device-based 2FA (e.g. Google Authenticator) will still be available.

### Required Variables

The following Terraform variables are required inputs and must be populated prior to beginning installation.

The values for these variables should be placed in the `terraform.tfvars` file. Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` in the `aws-standard` directory to `terraform.tfvars`, then edit it with the proper values. There are notes in the file regarding each variable, but please use the following list for more information:

**NOTE**: Use only alphanumeric characters (upper- and lower-case), as well as dashes, underscores, colons, and forward-slashes (`-`, `_`, `:`, `/`).  Other characters may cause the TFE instance to be unable to boot.

* `region`: The AWS region to deploy into.
* `ami_id`: The ID of a Terraform Enterprise Base AMI. See [`ami-ids`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-modules/blob/master/docs/ami-ids.md) to look one up.
* `fqdn`: The hostname that the cluster will be accessible at. This value needs to match the DNS setup for proper operations. Example: `tfe-eng01.mycompany.io`
* `cert_id`: An AWS certificate ARN. This is the certification that will be used by the ELB for the cluster. Example: `arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:241656615859:certificate/f32fa674-de62-4681-8035-21a4c81474c6`
* `instance_subnet_id`: Subnet ID of the subnet that the cluster's instance will be placed into. If this is a public subnet, the instance will be assigned a public IP. This is not required as the primary cluster interface is an ELB registered with the hostname. Example: `subnet-0de26b6a`
* `elb_subnet_id`: Subnet ID of the subnet that the cluster's load balancer will be placed into. If this is a public subnet, the load balancer will be accessible from the public internet. This is not required â€” the ELB can be marked as private via the `internal_elb` option below.
* `data_subnet_ids`: Subnet IDs that will be used to create the data services (RDS and ElastiCache) used by the cluster. There must be 2 subnet IDs given for proper redundency. Example: `["subnet-0ce26b6b", "subnet-d0f35099"]`
* `db_password`: Password that will be used to access RDS. Example: `databaseshavesecrets`
* `bucket_name`: Name of the S3 bucket to store artifacts used by the cluster into. This bucket is automatically created. We suggest you name it `tfe-<HOSTNAME>-data`, as convention.

### Optional Variables

These variables can be populated, but they have defaults that will be used if you omit them. As with the required variables, you can place these values in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

**NOTE**: Use only alphanumeric characters (upper- and lower-case), as well as dashes, underscores, colons, and forward-slashes (`-`, `_`, `:`, `/`).  Other characters may cause the TFE instance to be unable to boot.

* `key_name`: Name of AWS SSH Key Pair that will be used (as shown in the AWS console). The pair needs to already exist, it will not be created. **If this variable is not set, no SSH access will be available to the Terraform Enterprise instance.**
* `manage_bucket` Indicate if this Terraform state should create and own the bucket. Set this to false if you are reusing an existing bucket.
* `kms_key_id` Specify the ARN for a KMS key to use rather than having one
  created automatically.
* `db_username` Username that will be used to access RDS. Default: `atlas`
* `db_size_gb` Disk size of the RDS instance to create. Default: `80`
* `db_instance_class` Instance type of the RDS instance to create. Default: `db.m4.large`
* `db_multi_az` Configure if the RDS cluster should use multiple AZs to improve snapshot performance. Default: `true`
* `db_snapshot_identifier` Previously made snapshot to restore when RDS is created. This is for migration of data between clusters. Default is to create the database fresh.
* `db_name` This only needs to be set if you're migrating from an RDS instance with a different database name.
* `zone_id` The ID of a Route53 zone that a record for the cluster will be installed into. Leave this blank if you need to manage DNS elsewhere. Example: `ZVEF52R7NLTW6`
* `hostname` If specifying `zone_id`, this should be set to the name that is used for the record to be registered with the zone. This value combined with the zone information will form the full DNS name for Terraform Enterprise. Example: `emp-test`
* `arn_partition` Used mostly for govcloud installations. Example: `aws-us-gov`
* `internal_elb` Indicate to AWS that the created ELB is internal only. Example: `true`
* `startup_script` Shell code that should run on the first boot. This is explained in more detail below.
* `external_security_group_ids` The IDs of existing EC2 Security Groups to assign to the ELB for "external" access to the system. By default, a Security Group will be created that allows ingress to ports 80 and 443 from `0.0.0.0/0`.
* `internal_security_group_ids` The IDs of existing EC2 Security Groups to assign to the instance for "internal" access to the system. By default, a Security group will be created that allows ingress to ports 22 and 8080 from `0.0.0.0/0`.
* `proxy_url` A url (http or https, with port) to proxy all external http/https request from the cluster to. This is explained in more detail below.
* `no_proxy` Hosts to exclude from proxying, in addition to the default set. (Only applies when `proxy_url` is set.)
* `local_redis` If true, use a local Redis server on the cluster instance, eliminating the need for ElasticCache. Default: `false`
* `local_setup` If true, write the setup data to a local file called `tfe-setup-data` instead of into S3. The instance will prompt for this setup data on its first boot, after which point it will be stored in Vault. (Requires a release `v201709-1` or later to be set to true.) Default: `false`
* `ebs_size` The size (in GB) to configure the EBS volumes used to store redis data. Default: `100`
* `ebs_redundancy` The number of EBS volumes to mirror together for redundancy in storing redis data. Default: `2`
* `archivist_sse` Setting for server-side encryption of objects in S3; if provided, _must_ be set to `aws:kms`. Default: ``
* `archivist_kms_key_id` KMS key ID (full ARN) for server-side encryption of objects stored in S3.

#### Startup Script (Optional)

The `startup_script` variable can contain any shell code and will be executed on
the first boot. This mechanism can be used to customize the AMI, adding
additional software or configuration.

For example, to install a custom SSL certificate for the services to trust:

```
curl -o /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cert.crt https://my.server.net/custom.pem
update-ca-certificates
```

Be sure that files in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` end in `.crt` and that `update-ca-certificates` is run after they're placed.

Or to install additional Ubuntu packages:

```
apt-get install -y emacs
```

Because the content is likely to be multiple lines, we suggest you use the
heredoc style syntax to define the variable. For example, in your
`terraform.tfvars` file, you'd have:

```
startup_script = <<SHELL

apt-get install -y nano
adduser my-admin

SHELL
```

#### Proxy Support (Optional)

The cluster can be configured to send all outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic
through a proxy. By setting the `proxy_url` to either an http:// or https://
url, all systems that make HTTP and HTTPS request will connect to the proxy to
perform the request.

A comma-separated list of hosts to be excluded from proxying can be specified
via the `no_proxy` variable.

~> **Note:** This is only for outbound HTTP and HTTPS requests. Other traffic
such as SMTP and NTP are not proxied and will attempt to connect directly.

## Planning

Terraform Enterprise uses Terraform itself for deployment. Once you have filled in the `terraform.tfvars` file, simply run: `terraform init` then `terraform plan`. This will output the manifest of all the resources that will be created.

## Deployment

Once you've reviewed the plan output and are ready to deploy Terraform Enterprise, run `terraform apply`. This will take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes (mostly due to RDS creation time).

## Upgrade

To upgrade your instance of Terraform Enterprise, update the repository containing the terraform configuration, run `terraform plan`, and run `terraform apply`.

## Outputs

* `dns_name` - The DNS name of the load balancer for Terraform Enterprise. If you are managing
   DNS separately, you'll need to make a CNAME record from your indicated
   hostname to this value.
* `zone_id` - The Route53 Zone ID of the load balancer for Terraform Enterprise. If you are
   managing DNS separately but still using Route53, this value may be useful.
* `url` - The URL where Terraform Enterprise will become available when it boots.

## Configuration

After completing a new install you should head to the
[configuration page](./config.html) to create users and teams.
