# Private Terraform Enterprise Externally Managed Vault

Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE) can be configured to use an external Vault cluster
rather than the internal Vault instance. Within PTFE, Vault is used to
encrypt sensitive information such as variables and states.

An external Vault cluster allows the customer to have full control over how
the Vault cluster is managed, for example how it is sealed and unsealed, replicated, etc.

When an external Vault cluster is configured along with the External Services installation mode,
Private Terraform Enterprise becomes fully stateless and can be run in a hot-standby
configuration to provide failover.

-> **NOTE:** The external Vault option must be selected at initial installation, and cannot be changed later.
Do not attempt to migrate an existing Terraform Enterprise instance between internal and external
Vault options.

## Setup

Use the following as a guide to configure an external Vault instance:

1. Enable AppRole: `vault auth enable approle`
1. Enable transit: `vault secrets enable transit`
1. Install the `ptfe` policy (See below for policy):
   `vault policy write ptfe ptfe.hcl`
1. Create an AppRole instance:
   `vault write auth/approle/role/ptfe policies="ptfe"`.
1. Retrieve the AppRole `role_id`: `vault read auth/approle/role/ptfe/role-id`
1. Retrieve the AppRole `secret_id`:
   `vault write -f auth/approle/role/ptfe/secret-id`
1. Input the address of the vault cluster, role\_id, and secret\_id during the
   install process

## role\_id and secret\_id

The `role_id` and `secret_id` values created during configuration will be input during
the PTFE installation along with the Vault cluster URL such as
`https://vault.mycompany.com:8200`. If you use SSL to access the Vault cluster,
the certificate must be trusted by PTFE. That means the issuer of the certificate
is either globally trusted or you have provided the certificate for the issuer
in the "Certificate Authority bundle" section of the installer configuration.

## Vault Policy

Vault utilizes policies to restrict portions of the data. See [the official
Vault docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html) for a
more extensive overview.

The following policy is required for the correct operations of PTFE:

```
path "auth/approle/login" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read"]
}

path "sys/renew/*" {
  policy = "write"
}

path "auth/token/renew/*" {
  policy = "write"
}

path "transit/encrypt/atlas_*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}

path "transit/decrypt/atlas_*" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/archivist_*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}

# For decrypting datakey ciphertexts.
path "transit/decrypt/archivist_*" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

# To upsert the transit key used for datakey generation.
path "transit/keys/archivist_*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}

# For performing key derivation.
path "transit/datakey/plaintext/archivist_*" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

# For health checks to read the mount table.
path "sys/mounts" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```
