# Private Terraform Enterprise Reference Architecture (Installer)

HashiCorp provides Reference Architectures detailing the recommended
infrastructure and resources that should be provisioned in order to
support a highly-available Private Terraform Enterprise deployment.

Depending on where you choose to deploy Private Terraform Enterprise,
there are different services available to maximise the resiliency of
the deployment, for example, most major cloud service providers offer
a resilient relational database service offering, removing the need
for the customer to manage a complex database cluster/failover
architecture. We have taken this into consideration and created a
Reference Architecture for the most common deployment configurations,
making the most appropriate use of those cloud vendor services.
