# Administering Private Terraform Enterprise

Private Terraform Enterprise is software provided to customers that allows full use of Terraform Enterprise in a private, isolated environment.

This section is intended to guide customers on how to administer an existing instance of Private Terraform Enterprise, including general settings, systemwide integration settings, and entity management (users, workspaces, and runs). Administration functions can be managed via user interface (the focus of this guide) or via [Admin API](../api/admin/index.html).

* [Integration Settings](integrations.html)
* [Entity management](management.html)
