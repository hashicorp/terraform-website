# Administering Private Terraform Enterprise

Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE) is software provided to customers that allows full use of Terraform Enterprise in a private, isolated environment.

Administration of a PTFE instance has two main domains:

- Installation, upgrades, and operational tasks like backups and monitoring, which take place outside the Terraform Enterprise application.
- Administrative tasks and configuration within the application itself.

This section is about in-application administration, including general settings, systemwide integration settings, and management of accounts and resources. Administration functions can be managed via user interface (the focus of this guide) or via the [Admin API](../api/admin/index.html).

## Accessing the Admin Interface
