# Install and Configure Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise is deployed by an installer, which can be run interactively or in automation. Choose your preferred installation method from the sidebar navigation to the left.

~> **Important:** Terraform Enterprise has several requirements which must be met before installing it. At minimum, make sure you have read the [Pre-Install Checklist](docs/enterprise/before-installing/index.html) and prepared your credentials, decided on your operational mode, prepared data storage services or devices, and prepared an appropriate Linux instance for the software.
