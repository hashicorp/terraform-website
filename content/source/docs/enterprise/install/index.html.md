# Install and Configure Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise must be installed on a customer-controlled machine.

For installation instructions, choose your preferred deployment method from the sidebar navigation to the left.

~> **Important:** Terraform Enterprise has several requirements which must be met before installing it. At minimum, make sure you have read the [Pre-Install Checklist](../before-installing/index.html), decided on an operational mode, prepared your credentials, prepared data storage services or devices, and prepared an appropriate Linux instance for the software.
