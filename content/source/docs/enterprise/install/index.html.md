# Install and Configure Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise can be deployed in multiple ways:

- As a cluster, with a cloud-specific Terraform module (recommended for most enterprises).
- As individual instances, with an installer that can be run interactively or in automation.

For installation instructions, choose your preferred deployment method from the sidebar navigation to the left.

~> **Important:** Terraform Enterprise has several requirements which must be met before installing it. At minimum, make sure you have read the [Pre-Install Checklist](../before-installing/index.html) and decided on a deployment method and operational mode, prepared your credentials, prepared data storage services or devices, and prepared an appropriate Linux image or instance for the software.
