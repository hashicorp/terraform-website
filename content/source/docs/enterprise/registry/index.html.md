# Private Module Registry

Terraform Enterprise (TFE)'s private module registry helps you share [Terraform modules](/docs/modules/index.html) across your organization. It includes support for module versioning, a searchable and filterable list of available modules, and a configuration designer to help you build new workspaces faster.

By design, the private module registry works much like the [public Terraform Registry](/docs/registry/index.html). If you're already used the public registry, TFE's registry will feel familiar.

~> **Note:** Currently, the private module registry works with all supported VCS providers except Bitbucket Cloud.
