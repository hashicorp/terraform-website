# AAD Configuration

Follow these steps to configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the identity provider (IdP) for Terraform Enterprise.

-> **Tip:** > We suggest you use the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/terraform-enterprise-tutorial) Microsoft provides regarding setting up the TFE SSO gallery application.

~> **Note:** This guide assumes you have an appropriate licensing agreement for Azure Active Directory that supports non-gallery application single sign-on.

## Configure a New AAD Non-Gallery Application

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise Applications** and select **Add an Application**.

    ![Screenshot: AAD's "Add Application" page](./images/sso-aad-saml-add-application.png)

2. Select **Non-gallery application**. Provide a name for the application and click **Add**.

    ![Screenshot: AAD's dialog for beginning a new application](./images/sso-aad-saml-new-application-form.png)

3. AAD will automatically redirect to your new application settings. Navigate to **Single sign-on** and select **SAML**.

    ![Screenshot: the first page of AAD's new app configuration workflow, called "General Settings"](./images/sso-aad-saml-sso-method.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    - In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/users/saml/metadata`

    - In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/users/saml/auth`

	- In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/`

	~> **Note:** Update these values with the actual Identifier and Sign on URL. Contact [Terraform Enterprise Client support team](https://support.hashicorp.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your Terraform Enterprise application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is `user.userprincipalname` but Terraform Enterprise expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that, you can use `user.mail` attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

    ![Screenshot: Modifying the name identifier value.](./images/sso-aad-saml-user-claims-name-identifier.png)

6. Still in the **User Attributes & Claims** page, under **Manage user claims**, configure a user claim to map the team a user belongs to:
    
     - **Name:** `MemberOf`. This is the default name for TFE's group [attribute](./attributes.html); you can change this attribute's name in [TFE's SAML settings](./configuration.html).
    
     - **Source attribute** (drop-down): `user.assignedroles`. Azure Active Directory will create custom roles that will be used to map users and groups to TFE teams.

    ![Screenshot: Add MemberOf claim](./images/sso-aad-saml-user-claims-memberof.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot: Download the SAML signing certificate](./images/sso-aad-saml-signing-certificate.png)

8. Under the **Set up Terraform Enterprise** header, copy the **Login URL** and **Logout URL** that you will enter in your TFE configuration to link TFE to AAD.

    ![Screenshot: Azure Login/Logout URLs](./images/sso-aad-saml-urls.png)

9. Navigate to `https://<TFE_HOSTNAME>/app/admin/saml` and perform the following steps in the **SAML Settings** page:

    ![Screenshot: Terraform Enterprise SAML Settings](./images/sso-aad-saml-tfe-saml-settings.png)

    - Enable the **Enable SAML single sign-on** check box.
    - In the **Single Sign-On URL** textbox, paste the **Login URL** value which you copied from the Azure portal.
    - In the **Single Log-out URL** textbox, paste the **Login URL** value which you copied from the Azure portal.
    - Open the downloaded **Certificate** from the Azure portal into Notepad and paste the content into the **IDP CERTIFICATE** textbox. 

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal named B. Simon

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B. Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the `B.Simon@companydomain.extension`, replacing `companydomain.extension` with your company's domain name. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B. Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Terraform Enterprise.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Terraform Enterprise**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B. Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Custom Roles for Team Membership Mapping

1. Create teams in TFE as outlined in [TFE Team Membership](./team-membership.html).

2. Return to the Azure Portal, navigate to the **App registrations** page, and search for the application you created for TFE in the **Enterprise applications** page. Select your app and in the left sidebar select **Manifest**.

    ![Screenshot: AAD App Registration](./images/sso-aad-saml-app-registration.png)

3. In the manifest editor, locate the **appRoles** block. This is where you will add additional roles that map users and groups to teams in TFE.

    ![Screenshot: Manifest Editor](./images/sso-aad-saml-manifest-approles.png)

4. The **appRoles** block may contain roles automatically generated by AAD. Leave the automatically generated role GUIDs with their default values.  New roles should be added after the system roles and must contain a unique GUID value for the ID value of the new role. You can use a tool such as [GUID Generator](https://www.guidgenerator.com) to create the GUIDs for these new roles. Click **Save** to add the roles.

    -> **Tip:** You can add as many roles as your organization needs, such as the `site-admins` role. Azure AD will send the value of these roles as the claim value in the SAML response.

    The following role configuration example creates a new role named **Dev**:

    ```json
    {
    "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
    ],
    "displayName": "Dev",
    "id": "d1c2ade8-98f8-45fd-aa4a-6d06b947c66f",
    "isEnabled": true,
    "description": "Dev Team",
    "value": "Dev"
    }
    ```

    ![Screenshot: New role in Manifest Editor](./images/sso-aad-saml-manifest-devapprole.png)

5. Go back to **Enterprise applications**, and select the app you created for TFE. In the left sidebar, under the **Manage** heading, select **Users and Groups**. This is where you will enable access to TFE by adding either users or groups to your application. During the process of adding users or groups you will select a role to be assigned to the user or group. Select the role that matches the user or groups TFE team.

    ![Screenshot: Role Assignment](./images/sso-aad-saml-role-assignment.png)

Once you have added users, the initial configuration is complete, and they can begin logging into TFE with their AAD username and password.


## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

- Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Terraform Enterprise Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

- Go to Terraform Enterprise Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

- Go to Microsoft My Apps, then click the Terraform Enterprise tile. This will redirect to Terraform Enterprise Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Terraform Enterprise, you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. Learn how to [enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
