# Service Accounts

Terraform Enterprise (TFE) provides two types of service accounts: team, and organization. These accounts can access Terraform Enterprise APIs, but cannot be used interactively. The service accounts are designed to support server-to-server API calls using the service identity as opposed to individual user identities.

Team and organization service accounts don't have API tokens by default; you must generate a token before you can use them.

Like with [user tokens](./users.html#api-tokens), service account tokens are displayed only once when they are created, and are obfuscated thereafter. If the token is lost, it must be regenerated. When a token is regenerated, the previous token immediately becomes invalid.

~> **Important:** Unlike [user tokens][user token], team and organization tokens cannot authenticate with Terraform's `atlas` backend. This means they can't be used to run Terraform locally against state stored in TFE, access `terraform_remote_state` data sources during a run, or [migrate local state into TFE](../migrate/index.html). If you need to use the `atlas` backend for any reason, use a [user token][].

[user token]: ./users.html#api-tokens

## Team Service Accounts

-> **API:** See the [Team Token API](../api/team-tokens.html).

Team service accounts are designed to let automated systems (like CI/CD tools) perform Terraform runs and API operations with a specific set of workspace permissions.

Team tokens have the same access level as their team. For example, if a team has write access to a given workspace, the team's token can be used to update that workspace's variables, run `terraform apply` in that workspace with the `remote` backend, and create and apply runs in that workspace via the API. If a team has plan access to a workspace, the team's token can run `terraform plan` or create speculative plans via the API, but cannot update variables or make changes to real infrastructure.

To manage the API token for a team service account, go to **Organization settings > Teams > (desired team)** and use the controls under the "Team API Token" header.

Each team can have **one** valid API token at a time, and any member of a team can generate or revoke that team's token. When a token is regenerated, the previous token immediately becomes invalid.

Note that the individual members of a team can usually perform actions the team itself cannot, since users can belong to multiple teams in multiple organizations.

## Organization Service Accounts

-> **API:** See the [Organization Token API](../api/organization-tokens.html).

Organization service accounts are designed for creating and configuring workspaces and teams. We don't recommend using them as an all-purpose interface to TFE; their purpose is to do some initial setup before delegating a workspace to a team. For more routine interactions with workspaces, use team service accounts.

To manage the API token for an organization service account, go to **Organization settings > API Token** and use the controls under the "Organization Tokens" header.

Each organization can have **one** valid API token at a time. Only [organization owners](./teams.html#the-owners-team) can generate or revoke an organization's token.

Organization service accounts have permissions across the entire organization. They can perform all CRUD operations on most resources, but have some limitations; most importantly, they cannot start runs or create configuration versions. Any API endpoints that can't be used with an organization account include a note like the following:

-> **Note:** This endpoint cannot be accessed with [organization tokens](../users-teams-organizations/service-accounts.html#organization-service-accounts). You must access it with a [user token](../users-teams-organizations/users.html#api-tokens) or [team token](../users-teams-organizations/service-accounts.html#team-service-accounts).
