This document is intended to help guide customers on how to properly install Private Terraform into their Amazon VPC. This document will lay out the required prerequisites, steps to install the software and the basic configurations that will need to be done after install.

*Please note: This documentation is provided for customers who feel confident, after reading the full documentation, that they can successfully deploy Private Terraform on their own. If you are unsure, or have questions, please talk to your Sales Engineer \(pre-sales, POC or trial\) or Technical Account Manager \(existing customers\) about scheduling an assisted installation. If you are confident, and wish to do the install yourself, please still inform your Sales Engineer \(pre-sales, POC or trial\) or Technical Account Manager \(existing customers\) of your install time window so they can make sure they are available if necessary.*
