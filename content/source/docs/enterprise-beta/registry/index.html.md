# Private Module Registry

Terraform Enterprise (TFE)'s private module registry helps you share [Terraform modules](/docs/modules/index.html) across your organization. It includes support for module versioning, a searchable and filterable list of available modules, and a configuration designer to help you build new workspaces faster.

By design, the private module registry works much like the [public Terraform Registry](/docs/registry/index.html). If you're already used the public registry, TFE's registry will feel familiar.

~> **Note:** Currently, the private module registry is only enabled on private installs of TFE using Bitbucket Server as the VCS provider. Support for the SaaS version of TFE and other VCS providers is coming in a future update.
