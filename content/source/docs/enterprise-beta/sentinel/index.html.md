# Sentinel Policy as Code

[Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel) is an embedded policy as code
framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. It enables
fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions, and can be extended to use information from external sources.

To learn how to use Sentinel to enforce policies in Terraform, read [the Sentinel
documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/app/terraform/).
