# Users, Teams, and Organizations

This documentation explains the organizational and access control model in
Terraform Enterprise.

**Users** are individual members of an organization. They belong to teams which
are granted permissions to an organizationâ€™s workspaces. Users can also be
added directly to a workspace by being added as a collaborator.

**Teams** are groups of users that reflect your company's group
structure. Organization owners can create teams and manage membership.
Organization owners can give teams read, write, and admin permissions to
workspaces.

**Organizations** are a shared space for teams to collaborate on workspaces.
Organization owners set which users have read, write, and admin privileges on
which workspaces
