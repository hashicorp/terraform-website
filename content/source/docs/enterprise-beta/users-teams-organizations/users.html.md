# Users

Users are individual members of an organization. Users must first [create an account](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new) in Terraform Enterprise before
they can be added to an organization. After creating an account, users can be
added to an organization by joining a team.

To add a user to a team, navigate to the "Teams" section in your organization
settings. Create a team if it does not already exist or add the user to an
existing team.
