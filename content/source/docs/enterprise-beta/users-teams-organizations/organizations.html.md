# Organizations

Organizations are a shared space for teams to collaborate on workspaces.
Organization owners set which users have read, write, and admin privileges on
which workspaces.

If you navigate to TFE beta before you're a member of any organizations, you'll be asked to create one. You can also create a new organization at any time by going to an existing organization's settings, then clicking the "Create new organization" button in the sidebar navigation.

Invite users to join an organization by sending them the
[signup link](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new) and then adding them to a
[team](./teams.html).
