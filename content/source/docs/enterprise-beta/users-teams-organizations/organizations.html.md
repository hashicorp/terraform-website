# Organizations

Organizations are a shared space for teams to collaborate on workspaces.
Organization owners set which users have read, write, and admin privileges on
which workspaces.
[Create an organization here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/v2/organizations/new).

Invite users to join an organization by sending them the
[signup link](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new) and then add them to a
[team](./teams.html).
