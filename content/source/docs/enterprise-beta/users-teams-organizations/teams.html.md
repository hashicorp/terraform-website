# Teams

Teams are groups of users that reflect your company's group
structure. Organization owners can create teams and manage user membership.
Organization owners can give teams read, write, and admin permissions to
workspaces.

To create a team, navigate to the "Teams" section of your organization settings.
To give a team permissions on a specific workspace, navigate to the "Access
settings" on the workspace and add the team. A team can be given read, write, or
admin [permissions on a workspace](./permissions.html).
