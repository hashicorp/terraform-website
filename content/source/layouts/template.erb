<%#
This is a do-nothing template that's only here to prevent build breakages.
Please leave it be until all of the provider docs have migrated to the registry.

The reason it's here is because many providers initialized their docs directory
by copying content from the template provider. If they accidentally left any of
the template provider's docs files in place, or if they made a copy-paste error
when creating their own files, they can introduce pages that refer to the
`template` layout (the canonical copy of which was removed when the template
provider's docs were migrated to the registry). If that layout doesn't exist, it
breaks the whole website deploy job. So now that layout has to exist. FOREVER.
