# TFE Release v202106-1 (544)

### Application Level Features:

* Added support for several new capabilities in remote runs triggered via the CLI and API: `-refresh=false`, `-refresh-only`, and `-replace=ADDRESS`. See [the documentation](/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options) for more details on each of these options.
* Added Terraform CLI versions up through 0.15.5 to Terraform Enterprise.
* Changed Terraform Cost Estimation to use the new, free Azure pricing API. This changes the [Azure egress hostname](/enterprise/before-installing/network-requirements#prices-azure-com) to `prices.azure.com`.
* Updated the UX for the Registry
* Changed the Sentinel runtime to version 0.18.3. For the latest changes, see the [release notes](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/changelog).

* Fixed unexpected exceptions when accessing a JSON plan that was created before April 2019.
