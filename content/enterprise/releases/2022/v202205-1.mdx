# TFE Release v202205-1 (619)

## KNOWN ISSUES:

1. This release updates the method by which TFE talks to Vault. This change caused an unanticipated error when the vault namespace is not provided, preventing successful startup of the application. Effected users will see the following error in the `tfe-base-startup` container: `/usr/bin/vault-external-configure: line 37: VAULT_NAMESPACE: unbound variable`. If you do use a non-root namespace, providing that in the configuration should prevent this issue. If you use the root/default namespace, you should not upgrade to this version. 

## APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. All container names now follow the same naming convention: `tfe-<service>`. If you have tooling that identifies containers by name, make sure this tooling is updated to reflect the new naming convention.

## APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Add option to de-register [inactive Agents](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/agents#agent-capacity-usage) through the **Organization Settings > Agents** UI.

## APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed a bug where long words in a workspace readme were overflowing its column
2. Fixed potential issue when remembering 2FA logins with modern web browsers.
3. Changed logging to remove deprecation warnings related to :after_commit callbacks. This reduces noise in log output.
4. Fixed an issue with mock generation for nested attributes within a provider, which blocked Sentinel mocks from generating
5. Fixed application navigation to optimize for mobile use.
6. Fixed speculative, plan-only runs with incorrect run statuses that could prevent you from renaming workspaces.
7. Fixed a bug that broke retries for recoverable Git operations.
8. Fixed a bug that caused Git operations to retry unrecoverable authentication errors.
9. Improved agent dequeueing performance for large agent pools.
10. Changed Vault CLI commands to Vault API calls for token creation. This will prevent any Vault CLI/Server version mismatch errors.
11. Fixed issue where log tags such as "[Audit Log]" were not visible in logs.

## APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Adopted container updates to address reported vulnerabilities in underlying packages / dependencies.
2. Updated the version of the internally-managed Vault server to 1.10.2.
3. Updated the version of the internally-managed Nomad server to 1.2.6.
