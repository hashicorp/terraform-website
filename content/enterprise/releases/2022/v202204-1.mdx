# TFE Release v202204-1 (609)

## Known Issues

1. [April 21, 2022] This release includes an issue with the `tfe-bootstrap` container being unable to negotiate the Docker API version causing the installation and upgrade of Terraform Enterprise to fail with `Error response from daemon: client version 1.41 is too new. Maximum supported API version is 1.40` affecting docker `v19.03.x` or older. This issue is fixed in `v202204-2`.
2. [May 3, 2022] `tfe-admin health-check` fails with `sh: /root/ptfe-health-check: not found` after a change to the `ptfe_health_check` container Entrypoint to run the process as an unprivileged user under `/run/ptfe-health-check` but the `alias` was still referencing `/root/ptfe-health-check`. This issue will be fixed in `v202205-1`.
1. [May 10, 2022] This release includes an issue with Audit Log tagging, causing audit logs to no longer be tagged with the [Audit Log] prefix. This issue will be fixed in 'v202205-1'.

## UPCOMING APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGE

The Terraform Enterprise May 2022 release will change the names of application containers from `ptfe_*` to `tfe-*` for product consistency. For example, `ptfe_nginx` will be changed to `tfe-nginx`. If you have downstream configuration (monitoring, log forwarding etc.) that references the older naming scheme, you will need to update container references to the new names.


## APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES

1. The demo [operational mode](https://www.terraform.io/enterprise/before-installing#operational-mode-decision) has been removed. If you are currently running demo mode, we strongly suggest that you upgrade to Terraform Enterprise v202204-1. To do this, you must [migrate your application data](https://www.terraform.io/enterprise/admin/infrastructure/demo-to-disk-migration).


## APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES

1. Added a log storage memory limit to log forwarding. When the 128MB limit is reached, logs will be stored in a buffer on the filesystem until they can be forwarded.
1. Changed cost estimation so that it uses the [HTTP proxy settings](https://www.terraform.io/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#proxy-usage) configured within Terraform Enterprise.
1. Added the ability to specify an ['SSO team ID'](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/single-sign-on#team-names-and-sso-team-ids) for teams that Terraform Enterprise can use to map teams to non-human readable 'MemberOf' values in SAML assertions.
1. Updated display of download count metrics for modules in the private registry
1. Added an API endpoint to fetch a workspace's current state version outputs. Refer to https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-version-outputs#show-current-state-version-outputs-for-a-workspace for details
1. Updated the default `json-file` log rotation settings for all containers in order to improve the performance of support bundle generation.

       | Previous Settings | New Settings  |
       | :-:               |       :-:     |
       | `max-size: 10m` and `max-file: 3`| `max-size: 8m` and `max-file: 4`|
       | `max-size: 10m` and `max-file: 10` | `max-size: 32m` and `max-file: 4`|
       | `max-size: 100m` and `max-file: 10`| `max-size: 64m` and `max-file: 8`|
       | `max-size: 100m` and `max-file: 200`| `max-size: 50m` and `max-file: 20`|


## APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES

1. The [`iact_subnet_list` setting](/enterprise/install/automated/automating-the-installer#iact_subnet_list) now allows you to use `, ` to separate IPv4 addresses.
2. Fixed situation where occasionally you could not create a workspace after a workspace with the same name was deleted.
3. Fixed an issue causing configuration version tarballs downloaded through the API to have a non-human-readable filename and no file extension.
4. Fixed several issues with Terraform Cloud agent pools.


## APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES

1. Added no-cache and no-store headers for some API responses that may contain sensitive data (2FA configuration, SSO configuration, and state versions).
1. Removed credentials from health-check endpoint for an internal service.
1. Adopted container updates to address reported vulnerabilities in underlying packages / dependencies.
