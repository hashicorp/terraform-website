# TFE Release v202206-1 (636)

## APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added [Run Task](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) functionality to Terraform Enterprise.
1. Added several new run options to simplify Terraform upgrades: [perform plan-only runs with an alternate Terraform version](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/run/ui#testing-terraform-upgrades-with-speculative-plans), re-try completed speculative plans with an alternate Terraform version, and use [empty apply runs](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options#allow-empty-apply) to upgrade your state without requiring config changes. 
1. Added functionality to the [backup and restore API](https://www.terraform.io/enterprise/admin/infrastructure/backup-restore) that lets Terraform Enterprise skip backing up the object storage data. 
1. Added a warning in **Workspace > Settings > General** when you select a new Terraform version that is not recommended. 
1. Updated the email template used when testing SMTP configuration. 
1. Updated the email template used when sending VCS notifications. 
1. Added support for [sending notifications to Microsoft Teams channels](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications#microsoft-teams).
1. Terraform CLI versions up through 1.2.1 are now available.

1. Fixed a bug that was blocking users from cancelling runs in certain states.
1. Fixed a performance issue where requests to the `/workspaces` endpoint were taking longer than 3000ms.
1. Service Accounts will no longer be emailed when an Organization is deleted. 
1. Fix 'Copy' button in two-factor settings for copying recovery codes.
1. Fixed an issue where upgrading Terraform Enterprise would overwrite existing Terraform CLI Versions.
1. Fixed an unbound variable error issue when `extern_vault_namespace` was unset.
