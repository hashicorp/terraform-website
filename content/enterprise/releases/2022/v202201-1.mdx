# TFE Release v202201-1 (594)

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
1. If you are using Terraform CLI v1.1.0 or v1.1.1, please upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. Terraform CLI v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 both have a bug where a failure to construct the apply-time graph can cause Terraform to incorrectly report success and save an empty state, effectively “forgetting” all existing infrastructure. Although configurations that already worked on previous releases should not encounter this problem, it’s possible that incorrect future configuration changes would trigger this behavior during the apply step.

UPCOMING DEPRECATION NOTICES:
The Terraform Enterprise April 2022 release will:
1. Remove the [demo operational mode](https://www.terraform.io/enterprise/before-installing#operational-mode-decision), which is also known as the proof of concept (PoC) operational mode. The mounted disk operational mode will replace the demo operational mode for both non-production and production Terraform Enterprise environments. To check which mode your installation is using, run `replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .installation_type.Value }}'`. The value `poc` indicates that your installation is using the demo operational mode. The April 2022 release notes will contain more information about how to migrate.
1. Update the names of containers, which may break container monitoring or custom tooling that identifies containers by name. The April 2022 release notes will explain these name changes in more detail and provide a complete list of old and new container names.

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. Install-specific values are now available in the API. The UI also uses a new API-driven page configuration during bootstrapping.
1. Users who are logged in can now view and manage their active sessions within their user settings.
1. The [CLI integration](https://www.terraform.io/cli/cloud) is now available for using Terraform Enterprise from the command line. We recommend using this native integration for Terraform versions 1.1 or later, as it provides an improved user experience and various enhancements.

1. Added an outline to the public provider documentation page
