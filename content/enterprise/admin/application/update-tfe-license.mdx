  Updating Terraform Enterprise License - Application Administration - Terraform
  Enterprise
---

Terraform Enterprise requires an up-to-date license to maintain normal operations. These licenses have an expiration date, and must be updated once expired. This article provides the guidelines for updating licenses in Terraform Enterprise.

## Find the License Expiration Date

You can find the expiration date through either the Replicated console UI or the Replicated command line interface.

### Replicated Console

1. Navigate to the Replicated console at `https://<<TFE_HOSTNAME>>:8800`, and click on the gear icon in the top-right corner.

   ![View License](/img/docs/view-license.png)

1. Select the **View License** menu to display the license details, including the expiration date.

### Replicated Command Line Interface

1. Connect to the Terraform Enterprise host machine using SSH.

1. Use the `replicatedctl license inspect` command to inspect the license information. The `ExpirationTime` value in the output indicates the expiration date/time in UTC.

   ```shell
       $ replicatedctl license inspect
       [
       {
          "ID": "670bd320b95245325d80be703330f9b3",
          "Assignee": "Test Customer Name",
          "LegacyChannelName": "Stable",
          "ChannelID": "",
          "Channels": [],
          "ExpirationTime": "2021-06-30T00:00:00Z",
          "ExpirationPolicy": "ignore",
          "IsExpired": false,
          "IsActivationRequired": false,
          "ActivationEmail": "",
          "Fields": [
              {
                  "FieldName": "max_hosts",
                  "FieldTitle": "Maximum Number of Hosts",
                  "FieldType": "Integer",
                  "Value": "9999"
              },
              {
                  "FieldName": "min_hosts",
                  "FieldTitle": "Minimum Number of Hosts",
                  "FieldType": "Integer",
                  "Value": "1"
              }
          ]
       }
       ]
   ```

### Replicated Command Line Interface

1. Obtain the updated license and airgap package from HashiCorp and copy them to the Terraform Enterprise host.

1. Connect to the Terraform Enterprise host machine using SSH.

1. Execute the following command, updating the paths as needed.

   ````
   ```shell
   $ replicatedctl license-load \
       --airgap-package /path/to/bundle.airgap < /path/to/license.rli
   ```
   ````

## Troubleshooting

### No error but the license is not updated

In the Airgap installation, the license update operation may finish without any error but the license detail displayed on the Replicated console or the Replicated command line output is still not updated. This symptom can be related to the incorrect license file being used. In order to further identify the symptom, please follow these steps:

1. Connect to the Terraform Enterprise host machine using SSH.

1. Run `docker logs replicated` and look for the warning message below.

   ````
    ```plaintext
    WARN 2021-02-22T01:40:00+00:00 tasks/app_tasksteps.go:113 Airgap license on disk does not match installed license
    ```
   ````

1. Please contact your assigned Customer Success Manager or [HashiCorp Support](https://www.hashicorp.com/technical-support-services-and-policies) for further assistance. When contacting support, please include the output from running `replicatedctl license inspect` on the Terraform Enterprise host machine.

### Unable to sync license: Error: Unsuccessful HTTP response

Terraform can produce this error message for several different issues.

````
```plaintext
Unable to sync license: Error: Unsuccessful HTTP response
```
````

* Network communication to the Replicated servers

  Terraform Enterprise requires network communication to the Replicated endpoints, as noted in the [network requirements](/enterprise/before-installing/network-requirements) guideline. During the license sync operation, the Replicated installer attempts to contact `api.replicated.com` to retrieve the license information. In the online installation type, you might see the above error if the network infrastructure changed after you installed Terraform Enterprise. The specific IP addresses of Replicated services for the Terraform Enterprise are available in [Replicatedâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ips/blob/master/ip_addresses.json).

* Customer name on new license does not match existing license

  This may occur with an Airgap installation for a variety of reasons. One example is when a trial license is associated with a different customer name from the subsequent paid license.  Please contact [HashiCorp Support](https://www.hashicorp.com/technical-support-services-and-policies) for assistance. In your request, include the output from running`replicatedctl license inspect` on the Terraform Enterprise host machine.

### Incorrect version of airgap file

This error indicates that you are using the incorrect version of airgap file against the installed version of Terraform Enterprise.

````
```plaintext
installed app release (325b33bf0ad539c994644423128cad5e:502) does not match the airgap package
```
````

The airgap download page displays the versions of Terraform Enterprise and their SHA256 checksum values. Check these against the version of the airgap package in your local environment.
