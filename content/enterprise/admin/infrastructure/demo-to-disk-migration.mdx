# Migrating from Demo Mode to Mounted Disk Mode

Terraform Enterprise removed the Demo operational mode in v202204-1. We
strongly recommend upgrading your instance from Demo mode to Mounted Disk
mode.

If you are currently running Demo mode and wish to upgrade to Terraform
Enterprise v202204-1, you must migrate your application data from the Demo
mode Docker volumes to the Mounted Disk directory.

## Determining the Operational Mode

Connect to your Terraform Enterprise instance and run the following command.

```sh
replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .installation_type.Value }}'
```

If Terraform Enterprise returns the value `poc`, you are running Demo mode and
must migrate your application data to the mounted disk directory.

## Data Migration is Required

Terraform Enterprise will fail to start with the following error until you
migrate your application data.

```
Unmet start requirement: Required setting "Mounted Disk Path" is not set.
```

If you run `replicatedctl app status`, you will see output similar to the
following.

```json
[
    {
        "AppID": "f9486004126d40904381e029d76353d0",
        "Sequence": 609,
        "PatchSequence": 0,
        "State": "stopped",
        "DesiredState": "started",
        "Error": "Unmet start requirement: Required setting \"Mounted Disk Path\" is not set.",
        "IsCancellable": false,
        "IsTransitioning": false,
        "LastModifiedAt": "2022-04-11T21:02:18.613686589Z"
    }
]
```

The Replicated console shows the following page.

## Migrating Application Data From Demo Mode to Mounted Disk Mode

1. Connect to your Terraform Enterprise instance.

1. Create the mounted disk directory. You can choose any directory, but Terraform Enterprise expects that the directory is backed by persistent storage that can be mounted to the instance.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p /opt/terraform-enterprise
  ```

1. Set the `disk_path` application setting to the mounted disk directory.

  ```bash
  replicatedctl app-config set disk_path --value '/opt/terraform-enterprise'
  ```

1. Migrate the PostgreSQL data to the mounted disk directory.

    1. Create the `postgres` directory under the mounted disk directory.

      ```bash
      mkdir -p /opt/terraform-enterprise/postgres
      ```

    1. Retrieve the PostgreSQL data path from the Docker volume.

      ```bash
      demo_database="$(docker volume inspect postgres --format '{{ .Mountpoint }}')"
      ```

    1. Migrate the PostgreSQL data to the mounted disk directory.

      ```bash
      cp -r "${demo_database}"/* /opt/terraform-enterprise/postgres
      ```

    1. Mark the PostgreSQL data as migrated.

      ```bash
      touch /opt/terraform-enterprise/postgres/.poc-to-disk-migrated
      ```

1. Migrate the object storage data to the mounted disk directory.

    1. Create the `aux` directory under the mounted disk directory.

      ```bash
      mkdir -p /opt/terraform-enterprise/aux
      ```

    1. Retrieve the object storage data path from the Docker volume.

      ```bash
      demo_object_storage="$(docker volume inspect aux --format '{{ .Mountpoint }}')"
      ```

    1. Migrate the object storage data to the mounted disk directory.

      ```bash
      cp -r "${demo_object_storage}"/* /opt/terraform-enterprise/aux
      ```

    1. Mark the object storage data as migrated.

      ```bash
      touch /opt/terraform-enterprise/aux/.poc-to-disk-migrated
      ```

1. Restart Terraform Enterprise to apply the changes and start the application in Mounted Disk mode.

    1. Stop Terraform Enterprise.

      ```bash
      replicatedctl app stop
      ```

    1. Wait for Terraform Enterprise to stop. Terraform Enterprise is stopped once the `State` shows `stopped`.

      ```bash
      replicatedctl app status
      ```

    1. Start Terraform Enterprise.

      ```bash
      replicatedctl app start
      ```
