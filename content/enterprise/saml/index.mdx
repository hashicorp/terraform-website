# SAML Single Sign On

SAML is an XML-based standard for authentication and authorization. Terraform Enterprise can act as a service provider (SP) (or Relying Party) with your internal SAML identity provider (IdP).

Terraform Enterprise supports the SAML 2.0 standard. It has been tested with a variety of identity providers.
