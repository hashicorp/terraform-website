# PostgreSQL Requirements for Terraform Enterprise

-> **Note:** These requirements apply to the _External Services_ operational mode, not the _Mounted Disk_ operational mode. See the [Pre-Install Checklist](/enterprise/before-installing) for more information.

To use an external PostgreSQL database with Terraform Enterprise, the following
requirements must be met:

* A PostgreSQL server such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or a PostgreSQL-compatible server such as Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL must be used.
* The PostgreSQL server version must be one of the following:
  * 10.x, 11.x, 12.x
* A PostgreSQL user must be created with the following permissions on the database:
  * The ability to create, modify, and read all tables and indices on all schemas within the database. Usually this is granted if the user is an owner of the database.
  * The ability to create extensions. If it is not feasible to have a user with the "CREATE EXTENSION" privilege, then refer to the [Creating Extensions](#creating-extensions) section below for information on creating the necessary extensions.
* The `rails`, `vault`, and `registry` PostgreSQL schemas must be created on the database. In Terraform Enterprise v201911-1 and later, these schemas will be automatically created if they do not already exist. For Terraform Enterprise v201910-1 and earlier, these schemas must be manually created as detailed in the [Creating Schemas](#creating-schemas) section below.

## Creating Schemas

-> **Note:** This section can be skipped if installing Terraform Enterprise v201911-1 or later as the required database schemas will be automatically created by the Terraform Enterprise application.

If installing Terraform Enterprise v201910-1 or earlier, the database schemas
must be manually created. To create database schemas manually, the
`CREATE SCHEMA` command can be used. Execute the following snippet on the
PostgreSQL database to create the required database schemas manually:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS rails;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS vault;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS registry;
```

## Creating Extensions

If the configured PostgreSQL user does not have permission to create PostgreSQL extensions
(i.e. is not a superuser), then run the following SQL commands to create the proper extensions:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "hstore" WITH SCHEMA "rails";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA "rails";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "citext" WITH SCHEMA "registry";
```

## Connection Parameters

When providing optional extra keyword parameters for the database connection,
note an additional restriction on the `sslmode` parameter is that only the
`require`, `verify-full`, `verify-ca`, and `disable` values are allowed. The default value of `sslmode` is set to `require` for _External Services_ installations or `disable` for _Mounted Disk_ installations.

-> **Note:** See the PostgreSQL library documentation for more about [extra parameters related to sslmode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html). Terraform Enterprise provides a certificates file at `/tmp/cust-ca-certificates.crt`, which is required by the `verify-full` and `verify-ca` modes. Additional certificates can be added via the [CA Custom Bundle](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#certificate-authority-ca-bundle) setting.

-> **Note:** The [Client Certificates](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html) configuration is currently not supported by Terraform Enterprise due to the limitation of storing certificate files for the `sslcert`, and `sslkey` connection parameters.

## PostgreSQL 9.5 to 12 Upgrade

In Terraform Enterprise v202103-1, the internally-managed PostgreSQL server has been upgraded from PostgreSQL 9.5 to PostgreSQL 12. This change only affects mounted disk installations.

For more details, consult the v202103-1 [release notes](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-release-notes/blob/master/v202103-1.md).
