# TFE Release v202110-1 (576)

## Known Issues

1. [February 8, 2022] This release includes a regression that removed default log rotation settings of Docker logs using the `json-file` logging driver (the default driver), affecting log rotation on installations in which the new log forwarding feature is disabled. If the log forwarding feature is not enabled on your installation, it is recommended that you configure global log rotation settings to prevent disk space issues. For more information about configuring log rotation, please refer to https://terraform.io/enterprise/before-installing#log-rotation. This issue is fixed in v202201-2.

## Installer Level Features

## Application Level Bug Fixes

1. Updated Vault to version 1.8.4 to fix an issue where database connections were not properly being removed from the connection pool.
