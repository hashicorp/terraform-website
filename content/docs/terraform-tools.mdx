# Terraform Tools
Terraform is part of a rich infrastructure and DevOps ecosystem. The tools below extend Terraformâ€™s functionality or pair with Terraform to solve a broad range of infrastructure challenges.

## Develop and Validate Configuration

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|

CircleCI Orbs let you package, ship, and re-use configurations. | [Deploy Terraform infrastructure with CircleCI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/circle-ci) |
|[GitHub Actions for Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) | Third Party | Automate Terraform in your GitHub Actions workflow. After you have used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run Terraform commands using the GitHub Actions run syntax. | [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/github-actions) |

## Security and Compliance

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Splunk and Terraform Cloud](/docs/cloud/integrations/splunk/index.html) | HashiCorp | Pull audit logs from Terraform Cloud into Splunk to identify the most active policies, understand significant changes in resource operations, and filter actions by specific users within your organization. | |
| [Sentinel](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html) | HashiCorp |  Write and enforce fine-grained, logic-based policies for your infrastructure. Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. | [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/policy) |
