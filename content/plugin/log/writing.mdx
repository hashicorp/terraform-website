# Writing Log Output

Use the [`tflog` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog) to write logs for your provider. SDKs like the `terraform-plugin-framework`, `terraform-plugin-go`, and `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2` set up logging for you, so you only need to write the logs themselves. You can write log output at varying verbosity levels, add variables to logs, and create subsystems to group logs that relate to distinct sections of code (e.g., the API client).

!> **Warning:** Do not use `fmt.Println` and similar methods to log. They will silently fail, making the output unavailable.


## Structured Logging

The `tflog` package uses structured logging, based on [`go-hclog`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog). Rather than writing logs as sentences with embedded variables and values, `tflog` takes a sentence describing the logging event and a set of variables to log. When variables are separate from the log description, you can use them to programmatically parse, filter, and search log output. This separation also allows other parts of the system to associate variables with downstream log output.

## Log Levels

You must choose a verbosity level for each line of log output. This lets consumers [specify a type of log output](/plugin/log/managing#log-levels) to write from your provider. For example, you can use environment variables to set your provider to write only logs of type `Warn` during a Terraform run.

### Error

The least verbose output that typically describes an unexpected condition prior to halting execution. It often provides more information about a user-facing error.

```go
tflog.Error(ctx, "Unrecognized API response body")
```

### Warn

Output that describes an unexpected condition, but not one that should halt execution. It often includes deprecations or environment issues.

```go
tflog.Warn(ctx, "Retrying due to API server-side error")
```

### Info

Output that describes a certain logic condition or event. It often includes details about the environment your provider is running in or how it has been configured to run.

```go
tflog.Info(ctx, "Using API token for authentication")
```

### Debug

Verbose output that typically describes important operational details like milestones in logic. It often describes behaviors that may confusing even though they are correct.

```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Two identical diagnostics in the response, deduplicating down to one")
```

### Trace

The most verbose output that describes the lowest level operational details, such as intra-function steps or raw data.

```go
tflog.Trace(ctx, "Creating the widget")
```

## Variables

Use variables to attach information to specific logs or to an entire logger, which adds that information to all subsequent logs. You can also combine both methods to simplify your logging code.

### Single Log Variables

To specify filterable variables in the log output, add sets of key and value argument pairs after the log message. You can add as many key and value argument pairs as you need, but the key must always come before its associated value.

The following example adds both a URL and a method for an API request.

```go
tflog.Trace(ctx, "executing API request",
    "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint",
    "method", "POST")
```

You can also use other standard Go types for values.

```go
tflog.Trace(ctx, "executing API request",
    "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint",
    "method", "POST",
    "size", 200,
    "authenticated", true,
    "headers", map[string][]string{"content-type": []string{"application/json"}})
```

### Multiple Log Variables

Loggers are transported using a `context.Context` type, so injecting a variable into a logger returns a new `context.Context` containing the modified logger. Subsequent calls to `tflog` with that logger will implicitly include the variable.

Use [`tflog.With()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#With) to attach variables to a logger.

```go
// overwrite logger to include new `url` variable
ctx = tflog.With(ctx, "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint")

// will include the `url` variable
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Calling API")
```

You can also conditionally attach the variables by creating a new context and injecting it into the logger.

```go
// create new logger that includes `url` variable
apiContext := tflog.With(ctx, "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint")

// will not include the `url` variable
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Calling database")

// will include the `url` variable
tflog.Debug(apiContext, "Calling API")
```

## Subsystems

You can create a subsystem to manage loggers for sections of code that are large, complex, or have distinct functionality. You can then configure environment variables that allow each subsystem to be included or excluded from log output. For example, you may want to create a subsystem for logs that relate to the API client so that you can turn them off when when debugging an unrelated issue.

### Create Subsystems

To create a new subsystem, pass context and the subsystem name to the `NewSubsystem()` method.

```go
// my-subsystem is the name of the logging subsystem
// It will be available to subsequent calls via the tflog.Subsystem* functions.
ctx = tflog.NewSubsystem(ctx, "my-subsystem")
```

Optionally, specify a [log level](#log-levels) for the subsystem.

```go
ctx = tflog.NewSubsystem(ctx, "my-subsystem", hclog.Debug)
```

You can also create an environment variable to control the logging level instead of hardcoding it into the subsystem.

```go
// read the level from TF_LOG_PROVIDER_MYPROVIDER_CLIENT
ctx = tflog.NewSubsystem(ctx, "my-subsystem",
    tflog.WithLevelFromEnv("TF_LOG_PROVIDER_MYPROVIDER_CLIENT"))
```

### Use Subsystems

Logging or adding variables to subsystem loggers requires separate function calls for each [log level](#log-levels):

* [`tflog.SubsystemError()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemError): Equivalent to [`tflog.Error()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#Error), but using a subsystem logger.
* [`tflog.SubsystemWarn()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemWarn): Equivalent to [`tflog.Warn()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#Warn), but using a subsystem logger.
* [`tflog.SubsystemInfo()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemInfo): Equivalent to [`tflog.Info()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#Info), but using a subsystem logger.
* [`tflog.SubsystemDebug()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemDebug): Equivalent to [`tflog.Debug()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#Debug), but using a subsystem logger.
* [`tflog.SubsystemTrace()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemTrace): Equivalent to [`tflog.Trace()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#Trace), but using a subsystem logger.
* [`tflog.SubsystemWith()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemWith): Equivalent to [`tflog.With()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#With), but using a subsystem logger.

For example, use [`tflog.SubsystemDebug()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemDebug) to write a debug level log with a specific subsystem.

```go
tflog.SubsystemDebug(ctx, "my-subsystem", "writing to a subsystem", "meaning_of_life", 42)
```

Use [`tflog.SubsystemWith()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog#SubsystemWith) to attach variables to a specific subsystem.

```go
// overwrite logger to include new `url` variable
ctx = tflog.SubsystemWith(ctx, "my-subsystem", "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint")

// will include the `url` variable
tflog.SubsystemDebug(ctx, "my-subsystem", "Calling API")
```

You can also conditionally attach variables by creating a new context and injecting it into the logger.

```go
// create new logger that includes `url` variable
apiContext := tflog.SubsystemWith(ctx, "my-subsystem", "url", "https://www.example.com/my/endpoint")

// will not include the `url` variable
tflog.SubsystemDebug(ctx, "my-subsystem", "Calling database")

// will include the `url` variable
tflog.SubsystemDebug(apiContext, "my-subsystem", "Calling API")
```
