# Filtering Log Output

This page explains how to turn on logging, filter log output, and manage log format.

## Logging Environment Variables

Terraform, providers, and provider SDKs can all write logs that provide insight into operations and help you diagnose bugs. Logging is off for all of these subsystems by default, but you can set one or more of the logging environment variables below to either [`JSON` format](#log-format) or a [verbosity level](#logging-levels) to write logs for a Terraform run.

- To write all available logs from Terraform binary, all providers, and all provider SDKs, set `TF_LOG`.
- To write only a subset of logs (e.g., for a single provider), do not set `TF_LOG` and instead set specific logging environment variables for your use case.

Some environment variables take precedence over others. For example, if you set `TF_LOG=TRACE` and `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_AZUREM=WARN`, all provider logs will be written at the `TRACE` level because `TF_LOG` takes precedence.

| Variable | Logs Written By | Precedence and Usage |
| --------------|-------------|-------------|
| `TF_LOG` | All loggers (Terraform, SDKs, providers) | Overrides all other logging environment variables. |
| `TF_LOG_CORE` | Terraform binary | Does not include providers. |
| `TF_LOG_PROVIDER` | All providers and provider SDKs used during the run | Overrides logging environment variables for specific providers (e.g., `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_AWS`) and provider SDKs (e.g., `TF_LOG_PROTO`).|
| `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_{PROVIDER_NAME}` (e.g., `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_AWS`)| Specific provider  | Only applies to providers that write logs using the `tflog` package. Does not affect logs written by legacy `log.Print*` functions. |
|`TF_LOG_SDK` | All SDKs for providers used during the run | Only applies to logs written with `terraform-plugin-log`. For remaining SDKV2 logs, use `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`. |
| `TF_LOG_SDK_PROTO` | Protocol layer logging for providers built on [`terraform-plugin-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go). | Overrides `TF_LOG_SDK`. |
| `TF_LOG_SDK_HELPER_SCHEMA`| [`terraform-plugin-sdk/v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema) `helper/schema` package | Overrides `TF_LOG_SDK`. Only applies to logs written with `terraform-plugin-log`. For remaining SDKV2 logs, use `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`. |
|`TF_LOG_SDK_MUX`| [`terraform-plugin-mux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-mux)| Overrides `TF_LOG_SDK`.

-> **Note**: We recommend setting `TF_LOG=TRACE` when you report bugs to issue trackers. This turns on all loggers at their most verbose setting.

## Logging Levels

To specify logging verbosity, set a [logging environment variable](#logging-environment-variables) to one of the following values. The values are listed in order of least verbose to most verbose:

- **`OFF`** - Turns off logging for that logger.
- **`ERROR`** - Least verbose, typically provides more detail about user-facing errors.
- **`WARN`** - Typically includes warnings about deprecations or other environment problems.
- **`INFO`** - Can include details about run environment or configuration.
- **`DEBUG`** - Can include additional details about behavior, especially behaviors that may be non-intuitive.
- **`TRACE`** - Most verbose, typically includes low-level execution steps.

This example sets the loggers for all providers used in the run to `WARN` verbosity.

```
TF_LOG_PROVIDER=WARN
```

-> **Note:** Prior to Terraform v0.15.0, levels besides `TRACE` may not be
entirely reliable. Refer to [this
PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/26632) for more details.


## Log Format

By default, logs are written as plaintext lines, prefixed with a timestamp and the level in square braces.

```text
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ [Level] Message...
```

Explicitly setting the log format to `JSON` will output logs in a machine-readable format at the TRACE logging level. This format is not guaranteed to be stable between releases.

## Log Output Path

Use `TF_LOG_PATH` to specify a file path where the log output file should be written. If you do not specify a log path, Terraform writes the specified log output to `stderr`.

Terraform can automatically create the output file at `TF_LOG_PATH` if it does not already exist. If the file does exist, Terraform adds new log output onto the end of the file without truncating the file contents.

~> **Important:** Do not write to `stdout` because our plugin system uses this as a communication channel.


## Testing

During testing, Terraform ignores `TF_LOG_CORE`, and logging environment variables only control the log output for the provider under test. The [Acceptance testing](/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests#environment-variables) page contains additional environment variables to help you manage log output from tests.
