# Filtering Log Output

Terraform, provider SDKs, and providers can all write logs that provide insight into operations and can help you diagnose bugs. Use the environment variables on this page to turn on logging for one or more of these subsystems during a Terraform run. For each subsystem, you can specify the log verbosity level according to your use case.

## Logging Environment Variables

Logging is off for all subsystems by default. When you set one or more logging environment variables to a [verbosity level](#verbosity-levels-and-format), Terraform writes the specified logs for each Terraform run.

TBD something about how they cascade. When you report bugs to issue trackers, we recommend setting `TF_LOG=TRACE`.

| Variable Name | Scope | Precedence and Usage Notes |
| --------------|-------------|-------------|
`TF_LOG` | Terraform, the SDKs, and all providers | Overrides all other logging environment variables. |
| `TF_LOG_CORE` | Terraform binary, excluding providers | Only works if `TF_LOG` is not set.|
| `TF_LOG_PROVIDER` | All providers used during the run | Overrides provider-specific and SDK-specific logging environment variables.|
| `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_{PROVIDER_NAME}`| Single provider (e.g., `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_AWS`) | Only applies to providers that write logs using the `tflog` package. Does not affect logs written by legacy `log.Print*` functions. |
|`TF_LOG_SDK` | Provider SDKs for all providers used in the run | Overriden by SDK-specific environment variables. Only affects logs written with `terraform-plugin-log`. It does not yet apply to a large number of logs written by SDKv2 that use `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER` as their level. |
`TF_LOG_SDK_PROTO` | [`terraform-plugin-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go) | Overrides `TF_LOG_SDK` for logs written by `terraform-plugin-go` only. |
| `TF_LOG_SDK_HELPER_SCHEMA`| `helper/schema` package in [`terraform-plugin-sdk/v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema)  | Only affects logs written with `terraform-plugin-log`. It does not yet apply to a large number of logs written by SDKv2 that still use `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`. |
|`TF_LOG_SDK_MUX`| [`terraform-plugin-mux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-mux) module | Overrides `TF_LOG_SDK` for logs written by `terraform-plugin-mux` only.

## Verbosity Levels and Format

Valid levels you can pass to these environment variables are as follows, in order of most verbose to least verbose:

* `TRACE`
* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `OFF` (turns off logs for that logger)

As a special case, `JSON` will output logs in a machine-readable format, though the format is not guaranteed to be stable between releases.

## Setting the Log Output Path

Use `TF_LOG_PATH` to specify a file path where the log output file should be written. If you do not specify a log path, Terraform writes the specified log output to your standard error.

Terraform will automatically create the file at `TF_LOG_PATH` if necessary, but it _won't_ truncate the file contents if the file already exists. It will just add log output onto the end of the file.

## Tracing a Request

TBD add with functionality 


## Testing

When you test a provider, Terraform ignores `TF_LOG_CORE` and logging environment variables only control the log output for the provider under test. Use the following environment variables to change where Terraform stores the log outputs:

  - `TF_ACC_LOG_PATH`: Set a path to write all log output from Terraform, plugin SDKs, and all providers in the run. Terraform will generate the output at the `TRACE` level of verbosity.

  - `TF_LOG_PATH_MASK`: Set to a file path with a `%s` in the path to write test output to that path. Replace the `%s` with each test's name to write only that test's output to the file.
