# How Terraform Works With Plugins

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely
and efficiently. Terraform is built on a plugin-based architecture, enabling
developers to extend Terraform by writing new plugins or compiling modified
versions of existing plugins.

Terraform is logically split into two main parts: **Terraform Core** and
**Terraform Plugins**. Terraform Core uses remote procedure calls (RPC) to
communicate with Terraform Plugins, and offers multiple ways to discover and
load plugins to use.  Terraform Plugins expose an implementation for a specific
service, such as AWS, or provisioner, such as bash.

## Terraform Core

Terraform Core is a [statically-compiled binary][0] written in the [Go
programming language][1]. The compiled binary is the command line tool (CLI)
`terraform`, the entrypoint for anyone using Terraform. The code is open source
and hosted at github.com/hashicorp/terraform.

### The primary responsibilities of Terraform Core are:

- Infrastructure as code: reading and interpolating configuration files and
  modules
- Resource state management
- Construction of the [Resource Graph](/internals/graph)
- Plan execution
- Communication with plugins over RPC

## Terraform Plugins

Terraform Plugins are written in Go and are executable binaries invoked by
Terraform Core over RPC. Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific
service, such as AWS, or provisioner, such as bash. All Providers and
Provisioners used in Terraform configurations are plugins. They are executed as
a separate process and communicate with the main Terraform binary over an RPC
interface. Terraform has several Provisioners built-in, while Providers are
discovered dynamically as needed (See **Discovery** below). Terraform Core provides
a high-level framework that abstracts away the details of plugin discovery and
RPC communication so developers do not need to manage either.

Terraform Plugins are responsible for the domain specific implementation of
their type.

### The primary responsibilities of Provider Plugins are:

- Initialization of any included libraries used to make API calls
- Authentication with the Infrastructure Provider
- Define Resources that map to specific Services

### The primary responsibilities of Provisioner Plugins are:

- Executing commands or scripts on the designated Resource after creation, or on
  destruction.

## Discovery

~> **Advanced topic:** This section describes Terraform's plugin discovery
behavior at the level of detail a plugin developer might need. For instructions
suited to normal Terraform use, see [Configuring Providers](/language/providers/configuration).

When `terraform init` is run, Terraform reads configuration files in the working
directory to determine which plugins are necessary, searches for installed
plugins in several locations, sometimes downloads additional plugins, decides
which plugin versions to use, and writes a lock file to ensure Terraform will
use the same plugin versions in this directory until `terraform init` runs
again.

### Plugin Locations

The [Terraform CLI
docs](/cli/config/config-file#provider-installation)
have up-to-date and detailed information about where Terraform looks for plugin
binaries as part of `terraform init`. Consult that documentation for
[information on where to place binaries during
development](/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

### Selecting Plugins

After locating any installed plugins, `terraform init` compares them to the
configuration's [version constraints](/language/providers/configuration#provider-versions)
and chooses a version for each plugin as follows:

- If any acceptable versions are installed, Terraform uses the newest
  _installed_ version that meets the constraint (even if the
  [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
  has a newer acceptable version).
- If no acceptable versions are installed and the plugin is one of the
  [providers distributed by HashiCorp](/language/providers), Terraform
  downloads the newest acceptable version from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
  and saves it in a subdirectory under `.terraform/providers/`.
- If no acceptable versions are installed and the plugin is not distributed in
  the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/), initialization
  fails and the user must manually install an appropriate version.

### Upgrading Plugins

When `terraform init` is run with the `-upgrade` option, it re-checks the
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) for newer acceptable
provider versions and downloads them if available.

This behavior only applies to providers whose _only_ acceptable versions are in
the correct subdirectories under `.terraform/providers/` (the automatic downloads
directory); if any acceptable version of a given provider is installed
elsewhere, `terraform init -upgrade` will not download a newer version of it.
