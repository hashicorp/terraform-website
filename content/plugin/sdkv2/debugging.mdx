# Debugging Providers

This guide documents a few different ways to access more information about the
runtime operations of Terraform providers. It is intended for Terraform
provider developers, though sufficiently advanced users may also be able to use
it.

There are two available approaches to debugging Terraform providers. We'll talk
about each of them separately and in turn.

## Log-Based Debugging

Log-based debugging is a method of using logging calls to record what is
happening in a provider and then examining that record to diagnose issues. Logs can help you debug your provider without access to the environment or configuration.

When developing your provider, think carefully about what information you will need for debugging. Log lines cannot be inserted into the binary after it has been built. You will need to add a new log line and recompile your provider for new information to be surfaced in log output.

- [Managing Log Output](/plugin/log/managing) explains how to turn on logging, filter log output, choose the log format, and specify the log output path.
- [Writing Log Output](/plugin/log/writing) contains details about how to use the [`tflog` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog) to write log output at varying verbosity levels, add variables to logs, and create subsystems to group logs that relate to distinct sections of code (e.g., the API client).

## Debugger-Based Debugging

Debugger-based debugging is a method of using a debugging tool similar to
[delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) to inspect what is happening in a
provider as it is happening, often using breakpoints to pause execution of the
provider and examine the values of variables. This method of debugging must be
done contemporaneously; the developer doing the debugging needs to actively run
Terraform using the appropriate configuration and in the appropriate
environment to induce the behavior being examined. It is therefore most useful
when a bug is reliably reproducible. This level of analysis enables developers to
ask arbitrary questions and step through provider executions, allowing them to
explore what is happening in the provider during runtime.

-> **Note**: Debugger-based debugging only works with Terraform versions
0.12.26 and higher.

### Enabling Debugging In A Provider

Debugging is available for providers using Terraform Plugin SDK versions 2.0.0
and above. The plugin must also be started in debug
mode, called `plugin.Debug` instead of `plugin.Serve`. We recommend that you
enable this using a flag, as the provider should use `plugin.Serve` under
normal operation, when not being debugged.

```go
func main() {
	var debugMode bool

	flag.BoolVar(&debugMode, "debug", false, "set to true to run the provider with support for debuggers like delve")
	flag.Parse()

	opts := &plugin.ServeOpts{ProviderFunc: provider.New}

	if debugMode {
		// TODO: update this string with the full name of your provider as used in your configs
		err := plugin.Debug(context.Background(), "registry.terraform.io/my-org/my-provider", opts)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err.Error())
		}
		return
	}

	plugin.Serve(opts)
}
```

It is important to start a provider in debug mode only when you intend
to debug it, as its behavior will change in minor ways from normal operation of
providers. The main differences are:

* Terraform will not start the provider process; it must be run manually.
* The provider's constraints will no longer be checked as part of `terraform
  init`.
* The provider will no longer be restarted once per walk of the Terraform
  graph; instead the same provider process will be reused until the command is
  completed.

~> **Important:** You may need to disable compiler optimization and
[inlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion)
to have the debugger work efficiently with the provider binary.
To do so, build the provider binary with the necessary
[Go compiler flags (gcflags)](https://golang.org/cmd/compile/):
`go build -gcflags="all=-N -l"`

### Starting A Provider In Debug Mode

Once a provider has a debug mode added to its `main` function, it can be activated. Run your debugger, which is typically built into an editor or the Delve CLI, by passing it the provider binary as the command to execute. Specify any flags, environment variables, or other input that is necessary to start your provider.

#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) features native [debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) support with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go). The necessary launch configuration can be created within the repository as a `.vscode/launch.json` file, [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_global-launch-configuration), or [workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_workspace-launch-configurations).

An example `.vscode/launch.json` configuration file:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug Terraform Provider",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            // this assumes your workspace is the root of the repo
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "env": {},
            "args": [
                "-debug",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Running the editor debugger will output the reattach configuration to the debug console.

#### Delve CLI

Start a [`delve`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugging session:

```sh
$ dlv exec --accept-multiclient --continue --headless ./terraform-provider-example -- -debug
```

It will print output like the following to `stdout`:

```
Provider started, to attach Terraform set the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS env var:

        TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/my-org/my-provider":{"Protocol":"grpc","Pid":3382870,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/tmp/plugin713096927"}}}'
```

Connect your debugger, such as your editor or another delve CLI process, to the debugger server.

### Running Terraform With A Provider In Debug Mode

Copy the line starting with `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` from your provider's
output. Either export it, or prefix every Terraform command with it:

```sh
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/my-org/my-provider":{"Protocol":"grpc","Pid":3382870,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/tmp/plugin713096927"}}}' terraform apply
```

Run Terraform as usual. Any breakpoints you have set will halt execution and
show you the current variable values.
