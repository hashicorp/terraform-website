# Terraform Plugin SDKv2

Terraform Plugin SDKv2 is an established way to develop Terraform Plugins. It is the precursor to the [Terraform Plugin Framework](/plugin/framework), which is still in early development.

~> **Important**: [Which SDK Should I Use?](/plugin/which-sdk) explains the differences between the framework and SDKv2 to help you decide which option is right for your provider.

## Get Started

Try the [Call APIs with Custom Providers](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/providers?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorials on HashiCorp Learn.

## Key Concepts

- [Schemas](/plugin/sdkv2/schemas) define available fields for provider, resource, or provisioner configuration block, and give Terraform metadata about those fields.
- [Resources](/plugin/sdkv2/resources) are an abstraction that allow Terraform to manage infrastructure objects, such as a compute instance, an access policy, or disk. Providers act as a translation layer between Terraform and an API, offering one or more resources for practitioners to define in a configuration.

## Debug and Test

- Learn how to [debug your provider](/plugin/sdkv2/debugging) using either logging calls or a debugging tool.
- Learn how to [write successful acceptance and unit tests](/plugin/sdkv2/testing) for your provider.
