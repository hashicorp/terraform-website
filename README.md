## Where the Docs Live

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

[terraform.io][] is a static site built from Markdown source files using [Middleman][]. Unlike most such sites, it draws content from a lot of different Git repositories, which can make it challenging to contribute to.

**To find a page the easy way:** view it on [terraform.io][] and click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom. (As of Spring 2019, those links get routed to the correct repo for everything except the Google Cloud Platform provider.)

If you'd rather just remember where to look:

- This repository has the Terraform Enterprise docs, the Terraform GitHub Actions docs, and the Extending Terraform section.
    - Those files can be found at `content/source/docs/`. The `master` branch is the "live" content that gets deployed to terraform.io.
- The [hashicorp/terraform][tf-repo] repo has docs for most of Terraform CLI's core features, including the configuration language, the commands, and more.
    - Those files can be found at `website/docs`. The `stable-website` branch is the "live" content that gets deployed to terraform.io.
- Each provider repo in the [terraform-providers][] GitHub organization has its own provider's docs.
    - Those files can be found at `website/docs`. The `stable-website` branch is the "live" content that gets deployed to terraform.io.

The `stable-website` branch in Terraform and the provider repos has some special behavior. **Community members should target pull requests at `master` and not worry about it;** maintainers (and the curious) can see [More About `stable-website`][inpage-stable] below for more details.

## Deploying Changes to [terraform.io][]

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

- **For changes in this repo:** Merge the PR to master, and the site will automatically deploy in about 20m. ðŸ™Œ
- **For changes in hashicorp/terraform or terraform-providers/anything:** Merge the PR to master. Then, either:
    - Wait for the next release of the project in question. The changes will be deployed automatically.
    - If you don't want to wait for a release, cherry-pick the commit(s) to that repo's `stable-website` branch and push. Then, either:
        - Wait for the next unrelated site deploy (probably happening in a couple hours), which will pick up your changes automatically.
        - Do a manual CircleCI build or ask someone in the #proj-terraform-docs channel to do so.

The [terraform.io][] site gets deployed by a CI job, currently managed by CircleCI. This job can be run manually by many people within HashiCorp, and also runs automatically whenever a user in the HashiCorp GitHub org merges changes to master. (Note that Terraform releases and provider releases create sync commits to terraform-website, which will trigger a deploy.) In practice, the site gets deployed a few times a day.

## Running the Site Locally

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

You can preview the website from a local checkout of this repo as follows:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you have not already done so.
2. Go to the top directory of this repo in your terminal, and run `make website`.
3. Open `http://localhost:4567` in your web browser.
4. When you're done with the preview, press ctrl-C in your terminal to stop the server.

The local preview will include content from this repo and from any [_currently active_ submodules][inpage-submodules]; content from inactive submodules will be 404.

While the preview is running, you can edit pages and Middleman will automatically rebuild them.

## Previewing Changes from Providers or Terraform Core

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

To preview changes from your fork of Terraform or one of the providers, first make sure the necessary submodule is active:

1. **Init.** Run `git submodule init ext/terraform` or `git submodule init ext/providers/<SHORT NAME>` (where `<SHORT NAME>` is the name used in the provider's docs URLs).

    You can skip this if you know you've already initialized this submodule. But also it's idempotent, and running it again is probably faster than grepping the output of `git submodule status`.
2. **Update.** Run `git submodule update`.

    The init command doesn't actually init things all the way, so if you forget to run update, you might have a bad afternoon. (For more information, see [Living With Submodules][inpage-submodules] below.)

Once the submodule is active, you can go into its directory to fetch and check out new commits. If you plan to routinely edit those docs, you can add an additional remote to make it easier to fetch from and push to your fork.

You can even make direct edits to the submodule's content, as long as you remember to commit them and push your branch before resetting the submodule.

For example:

```
$ cd ext/providers/rundeck
$ git status
... (should show either tracking stable-website branch, or some detached HEAD commit)
$ git fetch <YOUR-REPO-URL> <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
$ git checkout FETCH_HEAD
... (will indicate that you are in a "detached HEAD state" against your branch)
```

To find your fork's repo URL, use the "Clone or Download" button on the main page of your fork on GitHub.

Once you finish testing your changes, you can reset the submodule to its normal state by returning to the root of `terraform-website` and running `git submodule update`.

> ### Tip: Refreshing Symlinked Nav Sidebars
>
> If you're updating a nav sidebar `.erb` file in a provider or in Terraform core, the Middleman preview server might not automatically refresh the affected pages. You can give it a nudge by finding `terraform-website`'s symlink to that `.erb` and running `touch -h` on it (for example, `touch -h content/source/layouts/aws.erb`).
>
> Stopping and restarting the preview server also works fine, but this can be faster.

## Writing Normal Docs Content

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Our docs content uses a fairly standard Middleman-ish/Jekyll-ish format.

### Files

One file per page. Filenames should usually end in `.html.md` or `.html.markdown`, which behave identically.

A page's location in the directory structure determines its URL.

- For files in this repo, the root of the site starts at `content/source/`.
- For files in the submodules, the actual files live somewhere in `ext/` and we use symlinks to put them somewhere under `content/source/`. You can check where the symlinks point with `ls -l`, or you can just find files with the "Edit this page" links on [terraform.io][].

### YAML Frontmatter

Each file should begin with YAML frontmatter, like this:

```
---
layout: "enterprise2"
page_title: "Naming - Workspaces - Terraform Enterprise"
sidebar_current: "docs-enterprise2-workspaces-naming"
---
```

Leave a blank line before the first line of Markdown content. We use the following frontmatter keys:

- `page_title` (required) â€” The title that displays in the browser's title bar. Generally formatted as `<PAGE> - <SECTION> - <PRODUCT>`, like "Naming - Workspaces - Terraform Enterprise".
- `layout` (required) â€” Which navigation sidebar to display for this page. A layout called `<NAME>` gets loaded from `./content/source/layouts/<NAME>.erb`.
- `description` (optional) â€”Â The blurb that appears in search results, to summarize everything you'll find on this page. Auto-generated if omitted.
- `sidebar_current` (deprecated) â€”Â No longer used for anything. Omit this from new pages, and feel free to remove it from existing ones.

### Link Style

When making a link to another page on the website:

- Always omit the protocol and hostname. (For example: `/docs/configuration/index.html`, not `https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html`.)
- When linking _within a given section_ of the docs, use relative links whenever possible. (For example: to link to `https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/ec2_transit_gateway.html` from another AWS resource, write `./ec2_transit_gateway.html`; from an AWS data source, write `../r/ec2_transit_gateway.html`.) This takes less space, and makes content more portable if we need to reorganize the site in the future (spoiler: we will).

### Content Formatting

Content is in Markdown, with a few local syntax additions described below. Try to keep it mostly pure Markdown; sometimes a little HTML is unavoidable, but not often.

#### Callouts

If you start a paragraph with a special arrow-like sigil, it will become a colored callout box. You can't make multi-paragraph callouts. For colorblind users (and for clarity in general), we try to start callouts with a strong-emphasized word to indicate their function.

Sigil | Start text with  | Color
------|------------------|-------
`->`  | `**Note:**`      | blue
`~>`  | `**Important:**` | yellow
`!>`  | `**Warning:**`   | red


#### Auto Header IDs

Like GitHub and a lot of other places, terraform.io automatically generates `id` attributes for headers to enable direct linking.

The basic transform to make IDs from header text is something like "lowercase it, delete anything other than `[a-z0-9_-]`, and replace runs of spaces with a hyphen," but since the exact behavior can be squirrelly, we recommend checking the actual ID in a preview before linking to it. The in-page quick-nav menu at the top of each page is helpful for finding the header you want.

We also auto-generate IDs for code spans that are the first child of a list item, since it's common for long lists of arguments or attributes to be formatted that way.

## Screenshots

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Some areas of documentation (mostly Terraform Cloud) make extensive use of screenshots. If you're adding or updating screenshots, please try to make them:

- 1024px wide
- As tall as necessary to show the content and any necessary context, but not taller
- 1x resolution

Both Firefox and Chrome have "responsive design" views for simulating various devices; this should let you lock the width and set the DPR to 1. (Firefox also has an integrated screenshot feature, located under the "dot dot dot" menu in the address bar.)

## Navigation Sidebars

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Every page should be reachable from a navigation sidebar, with only rare exceptions. _If you create a new page, add it to the relevant sidebar._

Sidebars are in .erb files, and can be found in `content/source/layouts/` (this repo), `website/layouts/` (terraform core), or `website/` (providers). A page uses the sidebar file that matches the `layout` key in its YAML frontmatter (plus the `.erb` extension).

Sidebars generally look like this:

```erb
<% wrap_layout :inner do %>
  <% content_for :sidebar do %>
    <h4>TITLE</h4>

    <ul class="nav docs-sidenav">
      <li>
        <a href="...">SECTION LINK</a>
        <ul class="nav">
          <li>
            <a href="...">PAGE IN SECTION</a>
          </li>
          ...
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <%= partial("layouts/otherdocs", :locals => { :skip => "Terraform Enterprise" }) %>
  <% end %>
  <%= yield %>
<% end %>
```

### CSS Classes for Sidebars

- `nav` -- Every `<ul>` in the sidebar should have this.
- `docs-sidenav` -- The outermost `<ul>` should also have this.
- `nav-auto-expand` -- Used for inner `<ul>`s that should default to "open" whenever their parent is opened. Useful for when you want to separate things into subcategories but don't want to require an extra click to navigate into those subcategories.
- `nav-visible` -- Used for inner `<ul>`s that should always display as "open," regardless of the current page. Use this sparingly, and avoid using it for large sections; readers can use the "expand all" control if they need to see everything at once.

A lot of existing sidebars have a ton of ERB tags that call a `sidebar_current` method. Ignore these, and don't worry about including them when making updates. They were for a hack that isn't needed anymore.

You don't need to add anything special to a sidebar to get the dynamic JavaScript open/close behavior, but note that the "expand all" and filter controls are only added for sidebars with more than a certain number of links.

## Living With Submodules

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

[inpage-submodules]: #living-with-submodules

Using submodules lets us keep the docs for providers and Terraform core right next to the code, which is very helpful for the engineers who do most of the docs updates. However, it imposes some extra costs when working with this repo. Here's how to get around the worst of those costs.

### Basics

In your local checkout of this repo, Git submodules can be active or sleeping. The `git submodule init <PATH>` and `git submodule deinit <PATH>` commands switch them between the two states.

Once you `init` a submodule, you usually need to run `git submodule update`, which will either do the initial checkout or update the working copy to the commit that `terraform-website` currently expects.

If a submodule shows up as "changed" in `git status` but you haven't done anything with it, it probably just means you updated your `terraform-website` branch and it now says the submodule should be at a newer commit. Run `git submodule update` to resolve it. Inactive submodules don't show up in `git status`.

In general, you should never need to commit a submodule update to `terraform-website`; updates get handled automatically during provider releases, and aren't necessary for getting new content onto the website anyway.

Avoid running `git rm` on a submodule unless you know what you're doing. You usually want `git submodule deinit` instead.

### Don't Keep Every Submodule Active

Earlier instructions for working with this repo said to use `git submodule init` (with no `<PATH>` argument) or `git submodule update --init` or `make sync` to activate everything. **Don't do that.** Git commands will take forever to run, and if your `$PS1` includes hints about the current directory's Git status, your entire terminal will slow to a **c r a w l.**

Instead, only init the specific submodules you currently need to work with (`git submodule init ext/providers/aws`), and feel free to de-init them when you're done. De-initting is non-destructive as long as you've committed your changes within the submodule (and preferably pushed your branch) -- Git keeps the repository data cached out of the way, so it dosen't even need to clone the entire repo again the next time you init it.

If you previously activated a hundred submodules and regret it, you can run `git submodule deinit --all` or `make deinit` to start fresh.

### ...Unless You Have to Search Every Page

On rare occasions, you may need to search every page on the site for something (usually a broken link). If that's the job, then you do need to init everything. Here's how to make that easier:

- `export PS1='$ '` if your prompt includes Git status, so your shell can at least run normal commands without becoming ill.
- If you're using a CLI search tool like [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), `cd` into the `content/source` directory and use the `--follow` / `-f` option with your search (or whatever option makes your tool of choice follow symlinks).
- Deinit all when you're done, and close your terminal tab so you can get your normal prompt back.

### New provider repositories

When creating a completely new provider repository, a few extra steps are required to be able to render the docs.

- Start by creating a layout in `terraform-provider-your-provider/website`.
  See [Navigation Sidebars](#navigation-sidebars) for more details.

- To simplify the following steps, set an environment variable in your shell with your provider name, like
  `export PROVIDER_REPO=your-provider`

- Finally, set up symlinks allowing `terraform-website` to correctly generate and link your files.

```bash
# link the new provider repo
pushd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/ext/providers"
ln -sf "$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_REPO" "$PROVIDER_REPO"
popd

# link the layout file
pushd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/content/source/layouts"
ln -sf "../../../ext/providers/$PROVIDER_REPO/website/$PROVIDER_REPO.erb" "$PROVIDER_REPO.erb"
popd

# link the content
pushd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/content/source/docs/providers"
ln -sf "../../../../ext/providers/$PROVIDER_REPO/website/docs" "$PROVIDER_REPO"
popd

# start middleman
cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_REPO"
make website

# Note: if you haven't already, copy a GNUmakefile from one of the other provider repos
# e.g.: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/blob/master/GNUmakefile
```

- Finally, open `http://localhost:4567/docs/providers/[your-provider]` in your web browser to visualize your provider's docs.

## Finding Broken Links

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Broken links are the scourge of the web, so the tooling around terraform.io includes some warning systems to help us spot and fix them. The process of working with those systems could be nicer, but here's how it works today.

### Step 1: See a Failing Build

There are two places that typically warn you about broken links:

- Failing Travis CI jobs. Travis builds happen for pull requests to `terraform-website` or `terraform`, and the result is shown in the PR.
- Failing CircleCI builds. Circle is what deploys the website to prod, and it sends success/fail messages to the `#proj-terraform-docs` channel in HashiCorp's Slack workspace. (This one isn't intended as a link check, but it spiders the whole site to warm up the Fastly cache, which has almost the same effect. The only real difference is that it obeys redirects, since it's hitting prod.)

In both of these cases, the failing job usually _doesn't_ mean the actual build or deploy failed, and instead means that the link-checking or cache-warming scripts found a broken link and exited with a non-zero status code.

### Step 1a: Identify the First Bad Build

If you noticed the failing builds early enough, you might be able to see the exact point where they flipped from green to red. If so, look at the commit associated with the first bad build!

Knowing the commit can save you a lot of time in step 4, when you're trying to figure out which files include the broken links.

If the build stayed red long enough for additional broken links to creep in, this will only help find the first batch. Thus, it's easier to deal with broken links if you catch them fast.

### Step 2: Find the Broken URL(s) in the Build Log

If you see a red build (on a PR or in the chatroom), click through to the build log. Once it's loaded, Cmd-F and search for the text "broken link". There might be more than one message, so make sure to search repeatedly (Cmd-G) to catch them all.

There are two kinds of messages you might see:

#### The Spidering Link Check

This task checks links in our actual website text.

```
Found 2 broken links.

http://127.0.0.1:4567/intro/getting-started/outputs.html
http://127.0.0.1:4567/intro/getting-started/variables.html
```

#### The Known Incoming Links Check

This task checks a list of our most popular search engine results to make sure we don't move important pages without redirecting them. (BY THE WAY, you should also redirect _unimportant_ pages whenever you move them. **URLs are forever.**)

```
2020-03-04 16:13:33 URL: http://127.0.0.1:4567/docs/providers/helm/index.html 200 OK
http://127.0.0.1:4567/docs/providers/helm/release.html:
Remote file does not exist -- broken link!!!
http://127.0.0.1:4567/docs/providers/helm/repository.html:
Remote file does not exist -- broken link!!!
```

### Step 3: Identify the Problem

Compare your findings to the error types above:

- If the error happened in the spidering link check, that means we have a wrong link somewhere in the actual page text or the sidebar navs.
- If the error happened in the known incoming links check, a page got moved and the links to it were maybe updated, but it probably wasn't redirected.

### Step 4: Locate the Problem

There are a few sub-steps here.

1. Figure out what's actually going on with the broken page(s).
    - What repo are they supposed to be in? (See [Where the Docs Live](#where-the-docs-live) above.)
    - Are they actually gone?
    - Did they _ever_ exist?
    - If the files ARE still there, check for broken YAML frontmatter or bad file extensions or bad charset encoding; sometimes those can break things.
    - If they moved, can you figure out what their new names/paths are?
    - `git log --follow -- <PATH>` is very helpful for this kind of detective work, and can often identify the person who can answer all the rest of your questions. (The `--` without a flag is used to tell Git that `<PATH>` is a file path, not a reference to a Git treeish. Usually that's not necessary, but Git needs the hint in cases where the file itself is gone.)
    - If it's a page from `hashicorp/terraform` or from one of the providers, make sure to check its status both on `master` and on the `stable-website` branch; sometimes there's already a fix in master and it just needs to be cherry-picked.
    - If it's a link to literally nowhere (like `./TODO` or some kind of Markdown syntax error), skip to the next sub-step.
2. Figure out what's up with the _links_ to the broken pages.
    - The list for the known incoming links check is at [`content/scripts/testdata/incoming-links.txt`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/blob/master/content/scripts/testdata/incoming-links.txt). If that's the type of error you got, that's where the reference is.
    - For links in text/navs it's a bit tougher, because the link checker doesn't tell you where the link CAME from, just where it tried to GO. So you'll have to actually search the source text of the site.
        - If you know the commit where the links went bad, that can narrow down the possibilities. Often it's just a "sync and edit website" commit that updated one or two submodules, but just knowing which submodules to check first can save a ton of time.
        - The best way to do this is with a local checkout of the affected repository(s) and a CLI text search utility like [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) or [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). (If you don't have either and are in a rush, `git grep` might work, but seriously, if you've read this far already you are _obviously_ the type of person who needs ag or rg.)
        - If the target page is in one of the providers, solid 99% chance the link is in that same provider.
        - If the target page is in this repo or `hashicorp/terraform`, ~80% chance the link is in one of those two places. (Could be either, since they cross-link pretty extensively.)
        - But sometimes, the target page is in this repo or Terraform core and the link comes from one of the providers. In the best case scenario, you might get lucky using GitHub's search feature in [the terraform-providers org](https://github.com/terraform-providers/). In the worst case scenario, you might need to `export PS1='$'`, init ALL of the submodules, tell your search tool to follow symlinks, and scan E V E R Y T H I N G.

### Step 5: Fix It

- If a page was moved: update any links to it, update its entry in `incoming-links.txt` if necessary, and add a redirect in [`content/redirects.txt`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/blob/master/content/redirects.txt).
- If a page was moved and already got redirected, you can go ahead and update or remove its entry in `incoming-links.txt`. It's common for people to forget that.
- If a page was deleted or split or something, figure out what the best place to redirect to is. Possibly a list of which features were removed in a given release, possibly something else.
- If a page was moved _to another domain_ (like learn.hashicorp.com), you need to go talk to `#team-eng-serv` and ask them to put in a redirect, because that's something that can't be done using redirects.txt.

## More About `stable-website`

â†¥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

[inpage-stable]: #more-about-stable-website

Each submodule repo (Terraform and the providers) is expected to have a special `stable-website` branch with docs for the most recent production release of that repo's software. When the website is deployed, it pulls in the current content of `stable-website` for every submodule.

The same CI system handles releases of Terraform and the various providers, and it has some special behavior around `stable-website`:

- When releasing a production build of Terraform or a provider, CI does a hard reset and a force-push to sync `stable-website` to the current release's commit.

    CI also automatically commits to `terraform-website` (this repo) to update every submodule to the current head of its `stable-website` branch, but this is only for the convenience of people working locally on the website; normal deployment to [terraform.io][] ignores the current state of the submodules.
- Between releases, engineers and others routinely update the docs on the `master` branch. By default, we assume these updates are relevant to the _next_ release, so we don't display them on the website yet.
- **If a docs update is also relevant to the current release,** it should be cherry-picked onto `stable-website` _after_ it has been merged to `master`. (Unless it's a low-priority fix that can wait until the next release.)

    This happens routinely, so anyone who can merge to `master` should also be able to merge to (or directly push) `stable-website`. Whoever clicks the merge button should make sure they know whether this commit needs a cherry-pick.
- During the next release, `stable-website` gets forcibly reset to that release's commit (which is probably from `master`), blowing away anything done on `stable-website` in the meantime.

To ensure your provider doesn't lose any docs content, make sure the only changes you merge to `stable-website` are cherry-picks from `master`. The only case for unique commits is if you specifically _want_ a change to be reverted upon the next release (for example, a warning about a bug that was just fixed on `master`).
